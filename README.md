# isx

**Give your AI coding agents their own machines — not your credentials.**

You're about to hand an AI agent a terminal. On your laptop, that terminal can read your API keys, your GitHub token, your `~/.ssh`, and every repo you have checked out — and anything it writes, your IDE and build tools will happily execute.

isx onboards agents the way you'd onboard a new teammate:

- **A real machine of their own.** Each agent gets a full Linux workstation — its own filesystem, init system, networking, and process tree. Templates can explicitly enable `sudo`, debugging capabilities, and nested containers when a workload needs them; hardened templates expose none of those privileges. Hardware-isolated KVM virtual machines are one flag away for untrusted code.
- **Zero credential exposure.** API keys and tokens never enter the environment in any form. A host-side TLS proxy injects real credentials upstream, so `claude`, `pi`, `gh`, `git`, and `curl` work unmodified inside — with nothing worth stealing. See [Credential Isolation](#credential-isolation).
- **Disposable in seconds.** Branch a prepared template like you'd branch a repo — instant copy-on-write clones. Use them, throw them away, branch again from a clean state.
- **Full autonomy, no babysitting.** Agents commit under their own identity and run without permission prompts — safe to let run, because the blast radius is the branch.

Runs on Linux and macOS, on your hardware. Your code and credentials never leave the building. Everything an agent does can be traced back to it — and nothing it does arrives uninvited.

Agents are the headline, not the limit: the same disposable machines are ideal for triaging untrusted patches, reproducing bug reports, and testing on a clean system — anything you'd rather not run on your host.

Built with [Quarkus](https://quarkus.io/) and [Tamboui](https://tamboui.dev/), powered by [Incus](https://linuxcontainers.org/incus/) system containers. *(isx was formerly known as incus-spawn.)*

## Quick Start

Requires **Linux or macOS**. On Linux, [Incus](https://linuxcontainers.org/incus/) runs natively and `isx init` auto-installs it via your package manager. On macOS, `isx init` provisions a lightweight Linux VM automatically via [vfkit](https://github.com/crc-org/vfkit). The VM starts automatically when needed and can be managed with `isx vm start|stop|restart|status|resize`. Windows is not yet supported.

**macOS limitations**: GUI/audio passthrough (Wayland + PipeWire) and `overlay` mode for host-resources are Linux-only features. On macOS, use `readonly` or `copy` modes for host-resources instead.

## Credential Isolation

**Upstream provider API keys and tokens never enter containers.** A host-side MITM TLS proxy (`isx proxy`) provides completely transparent authentication:

- The proxy uses bridge-level DNS overrides and a custom CA certificate so containers transparently route intercepted domains through the proxy
- The proxy terminates TLS, injects real authentication headers, and forwards to the real upstream over TLS — tools (`curl`, `git`, `gh`, `claude`, `pi`) work unmodified inside containers
- `https://bb.isx.internal` is a fixed gateway relay to the host's plain HTTP/WebSocket listener on `127.0.0.1:18444`. ISX provides DNS and container-facing TLS but performs no credential injection or debug body logging; it preserves the original `Host`, caller `Authorization`, and `bb-host-daemon.v1` WebSocket subprotocol so the host daemon remains responsible for authentication and policy. HTTP request bodies are limited to 16 MiB; an oversized bb event batch receives a permanent `invalid_request` response so the daemon can bisect it instead of wedging delivery
- Containers hold only placeholder values (e.g. `sk-ant-placeholder`) that satisfy tools' local auth checks; placeholders cannot authenticate against any real service
- **Vertex AI support**: the proxy transparently translates requests to Vertex AI format — no GCP credentials enter the container
- **Claude Pro/Max support**: authenticate via `claude setup-token`; the proxy injects the OAuth Bearer token transparently
- **Command-backed credentials**: a protected host-only configuration can obtain short-lived credentials from an absolute command, replace exact inert Bearer and/or raw-header placeholders, cache only in memory, and refresh once after a 401; no command or provider policy enters project or tool YAML
- **HTTPS only**: Git operations must use HTTPS URLs (not SSH). `gh` defaults to HTTPS; for `git clone`, use `https://github.com/...`

There is no API, endpoint, environment variable, or file that code inside the container can access to obtain upstream provider credentials — the injection happens entirely outside the trust boundary. A bb worker is different: its host daemon persists a per-host `bbdh_` capability under the same Unix account as the agent, so the gateway assumes that capability is agent-readable and limits it to bb's authenticated machine/session routes.

The proxy must be running for non-airgapped containers. `isx init` can install it as a systemd user service, or run `isx proxy` in a separate terminal. The CLI verifies proxy reachability and version compatibility before builds, branches, and shell access.

The proxy also caches container image layers and build artifacts on the host — the same dependency is never downloaded twice (see [Caching](#caching)).

### Git Configuration

Containers need a git identity (`user.name` and `user.email`) for commits. When a GitHub PAT is configured, the `gh` tool automatically generates a functional `.gitconfig` -- it queries the GitHub API for `user.name` and `user.email` (preferring the account's `@users.noreply.github.com` noreply address) and sets sensible defaults (`push.default`, `pull.ff`, common aliases). This works out of the box with no extra configuration. You choose whose PAT to use:

- **Dedicated agent account (recommended)** -- create a separate GitHub account for your agents and provide its PAT during `isx init`. This keeps agent commits clearly attributed, gives the agent its own identity for PR authorship and review workflows, and lets you scope repository permissions independently from your personal account.
- **Your personal account** -- provide your own PAT. If you also want your aliases and other settings, mount `~/.gitconfig` as a [host resource](#host-resources) -- it takes precedence over the auto-generated config.

To replace only the host-wrapped GitHub token from an existing environment variable without putting its value in argv or rerunning the complete initializer:

```sh
isx proxy github-token --from-env GITHUB_TOKEN_READONLY
isx proxy restart
isx proxy configure-dns
```

The command validates only bounded single-line token shape; it deliberately does not probe scopes or identity. Containers receive inert values in both `GITHUB_TOKEN` and `GH_TOKEN`, while the proxy uses the protected host configuration. Additional service-specific proxy definitions belong in external tool configuration rather than the ISX core.

**Commit signing.** Containers do not currently support signing commits. To produce signed commits, fetch the changes to your host via [git remotes](#git-remotes) and rebase there -- the host's signing configuration (GPG or SSH) applies automatically during the rebase. Native container-side signing is tracked in [#271](https://github.com/Sanne/incus-spawn/issues/271).

## Branching

Like `git branch`, branching creates an instant copy-on-write clone of any template. Each branch has its own independent filesystem -- changes in one branch cannot affect the template or any other branch. The storage backend (btrfs/zfs/lvm) deduplicates unchanged data automatically, so branches are instant to create and only consume disk space for their own modifications. `isx init` automatically creates a btrfs storage pool if needed.

```
tpl-java  (stopped template, ~2GB)
  ├── fix-nasty-bug    (running, uses ~50MB extra)
  ├── review-pr-423    (running, uses ~30MB extra)
  └── experiment       (stopped, uses ~10MB extra)
```

You can modify the branch freely within the privileges declared by its template, break things, and destroy it when done. The template and other branches are completely unaffected. `agentuser` is non-root and has no sudo access by default; templates that need passwordless sudo must opt in explicitly. Shell sessions set the terminal title to `isx:<containername>` so you always know which environment you're in.

Branches can optionally enable GUI/audio passthrough (Wayland + PipeWire with GPU acceleration, Linux only), restricted networking, or an inbox mount to share files read-only from the host. Resource limits (CPU, memory, disk) are auto-detected from the host but can be overridden. The interactive TUI (`isx` with no arguments) provides a Midnight Commander-style interface with modal dialogs for branching, renaming, and building, plus F3 detail views and F9 tool actions.

The TUI shows a storage gauge and per-row disk usage so you can see what's filling the pool. Sizes are approximate (marked `~`): the base template carries the shared base image, while CoW branches show only the data unique to them. Press **C** to reclaim space, or on macOS grow the disk with `isx vm resize <size>`.

Templates pre-install your baseline tools and repos, and integrations plug in through the same tool system: VS Code Remote, JetBrains Gateway, shell completions, and Claude Code skills.

### Network Modes

Each branch runs in one of three network modes:

| Mode | Flag | Description |
|------|------|-------------|
| **Full internet** | *(default)* | Unrestricted network access via NAT, auth via MITM proxy |
| **Proxy only** | `--proxy-only` | Outbound traffic restricted to MITM proxy only (iptables) |
| **Airgapped** | `--airgap` | Network device removed, complete isolation |

### Git Remotes

Containers created with `isx branch` are isolated environments, but you need a way to get your changes back. isx integrates with git's native remote helper protocol so you can use standard `git fetch`, `git push`, and `git pull` between host repos and container repos:

```shell
# Inside the container, the agent makes some commits...
# Back on the host:
git fetch fix-auth
git diff main..fix-auth/main    # review exactly what it did
git cherry-pick fix-auth/main   # take what you like
```

This is the intended review workflow: you always act on a specific, immutable commit — never on a live directory the agent can still modify (see the [FAQ](#faq) for why there is deliberately no read-write project mount).

#### isx:// URLs

The remote uses the `isx://` URL scheme (`~` expands to `/home/agentuser`):

```shell
git remote add fix-auth isx://fix-auth/~/quarkus
git fetch fix-auth
git diff main..fix-auth/main
```

The instance must be running for git operations to work.

#### Automatic remotes

If you configure `host-paths` in `~/.config/incus-spawn/config.yaml`, remotes are managed automatically:

```yaml
# Base directories where your repos live on the host
# Subdirectories are scanned recursively (up to 4 levels deep),
# so ~/projects finds ~/projects/java/my-repo, ~/projects/go/another-repo, etc.
# If a repo name appears in multiple locations, add an explicit repo-paths entry
host-paths:
  - ~/projects
  - ~/workspace

# Explicit overrides for repos in non-standard locations or to resolve ambiguity
repo-paths:
  quarkus: ~/work/quarkus
  hibernate: /opt/hibernate
```

With this configuration, `isx branch` adds a git remote named after the instance in each matching host repo (protocol-lenient — SSH and HTTPS URLs for the same repo are treated as equal), and `isx destroy` removes it.

## Why full system containers?

**Docker and Podman are built for shipping applications** — minimal filesystems, single-process isolation, fast startup. isx solves a different problem: full **system containers** powered by [Incus](https://linuxcontainers.org/incus/) that behave like real machines. Each environment runs its own init system, has real networking (`ping`, `strace`, nested Podman/Docker), and supports GUI and audio passthrough (Linux only). Templates pre-install your baseline tools and repos, but the environment is a real Linux system — agents and users can freely `dnf install`, `pip install`, build from source, or run Docker Compose just like on a workstation.

This matters for agents in particular: an agent boxed into an app container hits walls constantly (no systemd services and no way to opt into nested containers or debugging facilities). An isx template can expose those facilities declaratively when its workload needs them, while keeping other templates hardened.

For untrusted code, KVM virtual machines (`--vm`) provide hardware-level isolation with a separate kernel.

## Template Images

Template images are reusable base environments defined in YAML. They can inherit from each other -- building an image automatically builds any missing parents:

```yaml
# images/java.yaml
name: tpl-java
description: JDK + Maven
parent: tpl-dev
packages:
  - java-25-openjdk-devel
  - java-25-openjdk-javadoc
  - java-25-openjdk-src
tools:
  - maven-3
```

Four images are built in: hardened `tpl-minimal`, privileged development template `tpl-dev`, `tpl-java`, and hardened `tpl-bb`. The root image (`tpl-minimal`) uses a custom Fedora base from [`Sanne/incus-spawn-images`](https://github.com/Sanne/incus-spawn-images). Use `isx update-base` to check for new base image releases, pin a specific version, or track the latest:

```shell
isx update-base              # interactive — shows versions, prompts for action
isx update-base --list       # list available versions
isx update-base --latest     # track the newest release (remove any pin)
isx update-base fedora-44-v2 # pin to a specific release tag
```

Tracking latest is the default and requires no action: when the base image is unpinned, `isx build tpl-minimal` resolves the newest release at build time and installs it (falling back to the version baked into the binary if it can't reach the release list). Pinning writes a user-level override to `~/.config/incus-spawn/images/minimal.yaml`; `--latest` removes that override to resume tracking. After changing the base image version, rebuild with `isx build tpl-minimal`.

Add your own templates by placing YAML files in `~/.config/incus-spawn/images/` (user-level) or `.incus-spawn/images/` (project-local). You can also point to external directories via `searchPaths` in `config.yaml` (see [Configuration](#configuration)).

Use `isx templates` to manage templates from the CLI:

```shell
# List all available templates
isx templates list
isx templates list -v          # with source path and description

# Create a new template (opens in $EDITOR with a commented skeleton)
isx templates new my-app       # creates ~/.config/incus-spawn/images/my-app.yaml
isx templates new my-app --project  # creates .incus-spawn/images/my-app.yaml

# Edit an existing template
isx templates edit tpl-java    # opens in $EDITOR, validates on save
```

Editing a built-in template automatically creates a user-level override in `~/.config/incus-spawn/images/`. The override takes precedence over the built-in but will not auto-update with isx upgrades. Templates are validated after editing: YAML syntax, required fields, and parent references are checked.

You can also define a custom root image (no `parent`) by specifying `image`, `image_url`, `image_tag`, and `image_sha256` to point at your own pre-baked OS tarball. See the built-in [`minimal.yaml`](src/main/resources/images/minimal.yaml) and the [incus-spawn-images](https://github.com/Sanne/incus-spawn-images) repo for the reference example.

Image schema fields (all optional except `name`):
- `image` -- base OS image, only for root images (default: `images:fedora/44`)
- `image_url` -- download URL for the base image tarball (supports `{arch}` and `{tag}` placeholders)
- `image_tag` -- release tag identifying the base image version
- `image_sha256` -- per-architecture SHA256 checksums for integrity verification
- `type` -- instance type: `container` (default), `vm`, or `kvm`. VMs use a separate kernel for hardware-level isolation. `kvm` is a VM with `/dev/kvm` passthrough for nested virtualization. Inherits from parent -- a child without `type` inherits its parent's type
- `vm_image_url` -- download URL for the VM base image (qcow2 tarball). Only used when `type` is `vm` or `kvm`. Supports `{arch}` and `{tag}` placeholders
- `vm_image_sha256` -- per-architecture SHA256 checksums for the VM base image
- `parent` -- parent image name (omit for root images)
- `security` -- exact inherited privilege policy (see below)
- `packages` -- dnf packages to install
- `tools` -- tool names to run (resolved from YAML or Java, see [Custom Tools](#custom-tools))
- `repos` -- git repositories to clone as agentuser (see below)
- `skills` -- Claude Code skills to bake into the image (see below); accepts a list shorthand or an object with `repo` and `list` sub-fields
- `host-resources` -- host files/directories to share with containers (see below)
- `workdir` -- default working directory when shelling into a container (see below)
- `shell-command` -- command to run instead of the login shell (see below)
- `default-action` -- tool action to run when pressing Enter on an instance in the TUI (see below)
- `description` -- human-readable description for the TUI

Security is deny-by-default and inherited field by field. Every root starts with all three values disabled; a child inherits omitted values and may explicitly turn any inherited value off. At the end of every build, isx scrubs inherited or pre-baked privilege state and recreates only the selected capabilities:

```yaml
security:
  sudo: false
  nested-containers: false
  permissive-capabilities: false
```

- `sudo` installs the passwordless sudo rule for `agentuser`. When disabled, the rule and any `wheel`/`sudo` membership are removed.
- `nested-containers` enables the Incus nesting/idmap/setxattr/tun configuration and subordinate UID/GID ranges required by rootless Podman.
- `permissive-capabilities` retains all container capabilities and installs relaxed development sysctls for ping, dmesg, perf, and ptrace.

These settings are template-build policy, not branch-time switches. `tpl-dev` explicitly enables all three to preserve the full workstation/Podman experience, while `tpl-minimal` remains hardened. `tpl-bb` derives directly from `tpl-minimal` and adds Git, curl, Node.js (Fedora 44 provides Node 22.19 or newer), and npm for bb host bootstrap; it includes no provider tool or credentials and keeps all security options disabled. Unknown image or `security` fields are rejected rather than silently ignored.

```shell
# Build a specific image (builds missing parents automatically)
isx build tpl-java

# Build as a VM instead of a container (overrides the definition's type)
isx build tpl-java --type vm

# Rebuild a template and all its parents from scratch
isx build tpl-java --with-parents

# Rebuild out-of-sync templates (changed definitions or older isx version)
isx build --out-of-sync

# Rebuild all discovered images from scratch
isx build --all
```

The TUI marks templates with `!` when they were built with a different isx version, and `△` when the image or tool definition has changed since the last build — `isx build --out-of-sync` rebuilds these automatically. If a build fails, the container is promoted to an inspectable instance so you can shell in and debug.

### Declarative Repos

Images can declare git repositories to clone into the container.
Declaring a git repository rather than using shell commands to fetch it allows for better integration into other tools, such as Claude Code.

```yaml
name: tpl-quarkus
description: Quarkus development
parent: tpl-java
tools:
  - podman
  - gradle
repos:
  - url: https://github.com/quarkusio/quarkus.git
    path: ~/quarkus
    prime: mvn -B dependency:go-offline
```

Repo entry fields:
- `url` (required) -- git clone URL (HTTPS, for proxy compatibility)
- `path` (required) -- target directory (`~` expands to agentuser's home)
- `branch` (optional) -- branch or tag to check out; defaults to the repo's default branch
- `prime` (optional) -- shell command to run inside the repo directory after cloning, typically to pre-fetch dependencies (e.g. `mvn dependency:go-offline`, `gradle dependencies`)

Declared repos are automatically pre-trusted in `.claude.json` so Claude Code doesn't prompt for trust on first use.

### Shell Defaults

Templates can configure the default working directory, shell command, and default action when connecting to a container:

```yaml
name: tpl-quarkus
parent: tpl-java
tools: [claude]
repos:
  - url: https://github.com/quarkusio/quarkus.git
    path: ~/quarkus
workdir: ~/quarkus
default-action: claude
```

- `workdir` -- the directory to `cd` into when opening a shell. Defaults to the first declared repo's path if omitted.
- `shell-command` -- a command to run instead of the default login shell (e.g. `claude` or `pi`). Falls back to `bash --login` if it fails to start.
- `default-action` -- a tool action to run when pressing Enter on an instance in the TUI or when running `isx run <instance>` from the CLI. The value is a tool name (e.g. `claude`) if the tool has a single action, or `tool:action-id` (e.g. `claude:launch`) if the tool has multiple actions (see [Tool Actions](#tool-actions) for the `id` field). When set, Enter runs the action and F2 opens a shell; when unset, Enter/`isx run` opens a shell. Inherits from parent templates; a child overrides the parent's default action. No rebuild required when changing this field.

### Claude Code

Claude Code is Anthropic's official CLI for Claude. Add it to any template with `tools: [claude]`:

```yaml
name: tpl-agent
description: Isolated dev environment with Claude Code
parent: tpl-dev
repos:
  - url: https://github.com/myorg/myproject.git
    path: ~/myproject
workdir: ~/myproject
tools:
  - claude
default-action: claude
```

The `claude` tool downloads the latest Claude Code binary, configures permissions for unattended agent use, and sets up authentication. All three auth modes work transparently — the [MITM proxy](#credential-isolation) injects credentials so no real API keys or tokens enter the container.

To preconfigure which model Claude Code uses, pass the `model` parameter:

```yaml
tools:
  - claude:
      model: claude-sonnet-4-6
```

When omitted, Claude Code uses its own default. Model IDs follow the `claude-*` naming convention (e.g. `claude-opus-4-6`, `claude-sonnet-4-6`, `claude-haiku-4-5-20251001`).

### Pi Coding Agent

Pi is a provider-agnostic CLI coding agent that uses the standard Anthropic API. Add it to any template with `tools: [pi]`:

```yaml
name: tpl-pi-dev
description: Isolated dev environment with Pi coding agent
parent: tpl-dev
repos:
  - url: https://github.com/myorg/myproject.git
    path: ~/myproject
workdir: ~/myproject
tools:
  - pi
shell-command: pi
```

Pi works out of the box with all three auth modes (API key, Claude Pro/Max OAuth, Vertex AI) — the [MITM proxy](#credential-isolation) injects credentials transparently. To use Pi without making it the default shell, omit `shell-command` and launch it manually after `isx shell`.

### Bob Shell

Bob Shell is IBM's AI-powered coding assistant. Add it to any template with `tools: [bob]`:

```yaml
name: tpl-bob-dev
description: Isolated dev environment with Bob Shell
parent: tpl-dev
repos:
  - url: https://github.com/myorg/myproject.git
    path: ~/myproject
workdir: ~/myproject
tools:
  - bob
default-action: bob
```

Bob Shell requires an IBM API key ([create one here](https://bob.ibm.com/docs/ide/account/api-keys#create-an-api-key)). Run `isx init` to configure it — the real key stays on the host and the [MITM proxy](#credential-isolation) injects it transparently. Containers only hold a placeholder value. During `isx init` you'll be asked to accept the IBM license agreement; accepting pre-configures it in all containers so Bob Shell won't prompt again. The default action launches Bob with `--auto-approve` (auto-approve all tool calls); running `bob` manually in a shell uses normal approval mode.

### Claude Code Skills

Template images can declare [Claude Code skills](https://skills.sh) to bake in at build time. Skills are installed once into the template and inherited by every instance branched from it.

```yaml
name: tpl-agent
description: Agent with security skills
parent: tpl-dev
skills:
  repo: myorg/claude-skills      # default catalog for bare skill names
  list:
    - security-review            # short name → myorg/claude-skills@security-review
    - code-review                # short name → myorg/claude-skills@code-review
    - xixu-me/skills@xget        # explicit owner/repo@skill-name
    - myorg/catalog              # all skills from a repo
```

There is no implicit default catalog -- `repo` is only needed to resolve bare skill names (like `security-review` above). When all entries use the fully qualified `owner/repo@skill` or `owner/repo` form, you can omit `repo` and use the list shorthand:

```yaml
skills:
  - xixu-me/skills@xget
  - myorg/catalog
```

Skill source formats:
- `owner/repo@skill-name` -- specific skill from a GitHub repo
- `owner/repo` -- all skills from a GitHub repo
- `./local-path` -- local directory (relative to where `isx build` is run)
- `skill-name` -- bare name, resolved using the `skills.repo` field (required for bare names)

To find available skills, browse [skills.sh](https://skills.sh).

### Host Resources

Template images can declare host files and directories to make available inside containers. This is useful for sharing configuration files, pre-populating caches, or providing large datasets without copying them into every template.

```yaml
name: tpl-my-java
parent: tpl-java
host-resources:
  - source: ~/.m2/repository
    mode: overlay
  - source: ~/.gitconfig
```

The `~/.m2/repository` entry shares your host Maven cache with the container. With `mode: overlay`, the container sees a normal read-write directory pre-populated with your cached artifacts, but writes go to a container-local layer -- your host cache is never modified. Maven builds that would normally download hundreds of megabytes of dependencies can instead resolve them instantly from the shared cache.

The `~/.gitconfig` entry mounts your git configuration read-only (the default mode), so `git` inside the container picks up your name, email, aliases, and other settings (see [Git Configuration](#git-configuration)).

Three modes are available:

| Mode | Default? | Description |
|------|----------|-------------|
| `readonly` | Yes | Read-only bind mount. Simple, safe. |
| `overlay` | No | Read-only lower layer from host + ephemeral writable upper in the container. Tools see a normal read-write directory. Host is fully protected. **Linux only** — not yet supported on macOS. |
| `copy` | No | Copied into the container at build time. Becomes part of the template. Also supports URL sources. |

If `path` is omitted, it defaults to the same relative path under `/home/agentuser/`. Missing host paths are skipped with a warning, so templates remain portable. Host resources compose across the parent chain, with child entries overriding parent entries matched by container path.

**VM note:** VMs mount disk devices via virtiofs (asynchronously, after the incus-agent starts). For overlay mode, the build waits up to 15 seconds for the device to appear before mounting. File-level host resources (single files rather than directories) automatically fall back to `copy` mode on VMs, since Incus disk devices only support directory mounts for VMs.

## Custom Tools

Template inheritance forms a single chain -- a template has exactly one parent. Tools provide composition: reusable capabilities that any template can mix in independently. A `gradle` tool can be added to a Java template, a Kotlin template, or a project-local template without duplicating definitions or creating diamond inheritance.

Tools are defined as YAML files and referenced from image definitions via `tools:`:

```yaml
# .incus-spawn/tools/gradle.yaml
name: gradle
description: Gradle 9.4.1

downloads:
  - url: https://services.gradle.org/distributions/gradle-9.4.1-bin.zip
    sha256: 2ab2958f2a1e51120c326cad6f385153bb11ee93b3c216c5fccebfdfbb7ec6cb
    extract: /opt
    links:
      /opt/gradle-9.4.1/bin/gradle: /usr/local/bin/gradle

verify: gradle --version

```

Downloads declared this way are cached on the host at `~/.cache/incus-spawn/downloads/`, so rebuilding images doesn't re-download unchanged artifacts.
Extraction happens on the host -- the container doesn't need `tar`, `unzip`, or `curl`.

Tool schema fields (all optional except `name`):
- `packages` -- dnf packages to install
- `downloads` -- artifacts to download, cache on the host, and copy and/or extract into the container
- `requires` -- list of other tool names that must be installed first (resolved transitively; circular dependencies are detected and rejected)
- `run` -- shell commands as root
- `run_as_user` -- shell commands as agentuser
- `files` -- files to write (with optional `owner`)
- `env` -- environment variables written to `/etc/profile.d/isx-env.sh` (supports structured entries with merge strategies; see below)
- `verify` -- verification command (logged, non-fatal)
- `actions` -- runtime actions available from the TUI when the tool is installed (see [Tool Actions](#tool-actions))
- `proxy` -- credential injection rules for the MITM proxy (see [Proxy Credentials](#proxy-credentials))

Download entry fields:
- `url` (required) -- download URL
- `sha256` (recommended) -- SHA-256 checksum; enables cache reuse and verifies integrity
- `extract` (optional) -- directory in the container to extract into
- `destination_file` (optional) -- exact path at which to expose the downloaded file in the container; `~/` resolves to `/home/agentuser/`
- `extract_in_container` (optional) -- extract inside the container instead of on the host
- `links` (optional) -- map of `source_path: symlink_path` to create after extraction

Each download must set `extract`, `destination_file`, or both. Setting both preserves the downloaded archive at `destination_file` and also exposes its extracted contents. Supported archive formats for `extract` are `.tar.gz`/`.tgz`, `.tar.bz2`, `.tar.xz`, `.zip`.

Execution order during `install()`: packages → downloads → `run` → `run_as_user` → `files` → `verify`. Environment variables are collected from all tools and the template chain after install, then written centrally. Resolution follows the same order as templates (see [Configuration](#configuration)).

#### Environment Variables

Environment variables support four merge strategies:

```yaml
env:
  # Simple set (default strategy):
  - name: MAVEN_HOME
    value: /opt/apache-maven-3.9.16

  # Set only if not already defined:
  - name: DOCKER_HOST
    value: "unix:///var/run/docker.sock"
    strategy: set-if-unset

  # Prepend to existing value (with separator):
  - name: MAVEN_OPTS
    value: "-Xmx2g"
    strategy: prepend
    separator: " "

  # Append to existing value:
  - name: PATH
    value: /opt/bin
    strategy: append
    separator: ":"
```

All env entries from the template chain and installed tools are collected by the build system and written to `/etc/profile.d/isx-env.sh`. **Conflicting definitions are caught at build time**: if two tools both `set` the same variable to different values, the build fails with a descriptive error naming both sources. Backward-compatible raw shell strings (`- export FOO=bar`) are still accepted but bypass conflict detection.

Templates can also declare environment variables directly:

```yaml
name: tpl-my-project
parent: tpl-dev
env:
  - name: MY_DEBUG
    value: "true"
    strategy: set-if-unset
```

#### Proxy Credentials

Tools can register domains with the [MITM proxy](#credential-isolation) for transparent credential injection. This lets you add authentication to any HTTPS API without exposing secrets inside containers. The built-in `claude`, `gh`, `bob`, and `codex` tools use this mechanism -- but you can declare the same for your own tools.

A `proxy:` block has three parts: a `config-namespace` that scopes config paths, a `configuration` map that declares what credentials are needed, and `auth` entries that map domains to authentication rules.

```yaml
# ~/.config/incus-spawn/tools/artifactory.yaml
name: artifactory
description: JFrog Artifactory

proxy:
  config-namespace: artifactory
  configuration:
    token:
      config-path: "token"
      description: "Artifactory API token"
      secret: true
  auth:
    - domains:
        - artifactory.internal.example.com
      type: bearer
      token: "${token}"
```

After placing this file, `isx init` will prompt for the Artifactory token alongside other credentials. The token is stored in `~/.config/incus-spawn/config.yaml` under `artifactory.token` (the namespace prefixes the config path). Inside containers, HTTPS requests to `artifactory.internal.example.com` get a `Authorization: Bearer <token>` header injected automatically -- no configuration inside the container needed.

Three auth types are supported:

| Type | Injected header | Required fields |
|------|----------------|-----------------|
| `bearer` | `Authorization: Bearer <token>` | `token` |
| `basic` | `Authorization: Basic <base64(username:password)>` | `username`, `password` |
| `header` | Custom header | `name`, `value` |

Auth fields can be literal values (e.g. `username: "deploy-bot"`) or `${configKey}` references resolved against the `configuration` map. A tool with all three types:

```yaml
proxy:
  config-namespace: myService
  configuration:
    api-key:
      config-path: "apiKey"
      description: "API key for myservice.com"
      secret: true
    password:
      config-path: "password"
      description: "Registry password"
      secret: true
  auth:
    - domains:
        - api.myservice.com
      type: bearer
      token: "${api-key}"
    - domains:
        - registry.myservice.com
      type: basic
      username: "deploy-bot"
      password: "${password}"
    - domains:
        - "*.internal.myservice.com"
      type: header
      name: X-API-Key
      value: "${api-key}"
```

Wildcard domains (`*.internal.myservice.com`) match any subdomain. The most specific wildcard wins when multiple tools register overlapping suffixes.

Configuration entries can also use `value` for hardcoded literals (no prompt during `isx init`) and `type: confirm` for yes/no prompts like license acceptance.

Tool YAML files with `proxy:` blocks must be placed in `~/.config/incus-spawn/tools/` or a configured search path -- project-local tools (`.incus-spawn/tools/`) cannot declare proxy rules because the proxy daemon runs independently of any project directory.

#### Command-backed proxy credentials

Commands that mint short-lived credentials belong only in the protected, machine-local `~/.config/incus-spawn/command-credentials.yaml`; they are not supported in tool definitions, project YAML, or `config.yaml`. An absent file or an explicit `rules: []` disables the feature. Any other present file is strict and fail-closed: it must be a regular non-symlink file with no group or other permissions (`chmod 600`), and zero-byte files, malformed YAML, duplicate keys, unknown fields, unsafe values, and route collisions prevent the proxy from starting.

Each rule targets one exact lowercase DNS host. The route is always HTTPS on port 443; schemes, ports, wildcards, and subdomains are not configurable. For example:

```yaml
rules:
  - id: example-gateway
    host: credential.example.test
    argv:
      - /usr/local/bin/credential-helper
      - print
    validation-regex: 'token_[A-Za-z0-9]{16,}'
    carriers:
      bearer:
        placeholder: container-placeholder
      header:
        name: x-api-key
        placeholder: container-placeholder
    timeout-seconds: 15
    max-output-bytes: 8192
    body-limit-bytes: 16777216
    cache-ttl-seconds: 300
    failure-ttl-seconds: 5
    label: Example credential gateway
    remediation: Repair host credential access
```

A file may contain at most 128 rules. `id` is a unique 1–63 character lowercase identifier. `argv` contains 1–32 entries and its executable must be absolute; the proxy passes it directly to `ProcessBuilder`, never through a shell. The command inherits no environment. It receives only `HOME`, `USER`, `LOGNAME`, `TMPDIR`, and the fixed safe `PATH` `/opt/homebrew/bin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin`; stderr is discarded. `timeout-seconds` is 1–60, `max-output-bytes` is 1–65536, `body-limit-bytes` is 1–67108864, `cache-ttl-seconds` is 1–86400, and `failure-ttl-seconds` is 1–300. Stdout must be exactly one UTF-8 line matching the configured `validation-regex`.

At least one carrier is required. The Bearer carrier matches only `Authorization: Bearer <configured-placeholder>`; the optional raw carrier matches one named end-to-end header with exactly its configured placeholder. A placeholder that matches the credential validation regex is rejected as non-inert. Requests with missing, duplicate, unsupported, or non-exact carriers fail locally, as do bodies above the configured declared or observed limit. The credential is kept only in a generation-aware, single-flight memory cache; acquisition failures use the configured negative-cache TTL. A 401 drains the response, conditionally invalidates that generation, and retries once. Command-backed exchanges bypass debug capture and deny WebSocket upgrades. `/health`, the TUI, and `isx doctor` report only the configured generic label, failure detail, and remediation, never argv or command output.

Rule hosts participate in leaf certificate generation, routing, and the complete bridge DNS set. They may not collide with built-in routes, exact tool routes, or tool wildcard routes. Rules are loaded once when the proxy starts: ordinary `config.yaml`/CA reloads retain the loaded rules. After editing this file, apply it with:

```shell
isx proxy restart
isx proxy configure-dns
```

### Remote IDE Access

Both VS Code and JetBrains IntelliJ can connect to containers with their UI running natively on the host and all backend processing (indexing, builds, terminals, extensions) running inside the container. SSH keys are managed automatically: `isx init` generates a dedicated passphraseless key pair at `~/.config/incus-spawn/ssh/`, and each branch injects it into the container along with your personal `~/.ssh` key. Container host keys are pre-validated so `ssh <instance-name>` just works — no passphrase prompt, no host key warning. Entries are cleaned up when instances are destroyed.

Both tools declare TUI actions — press **F9** on a running instance to open a repo directly in your IDE.

#### VS Code (Remote - SSH)

The built-in `vscode-remote` tool provides one-click "Open in VS Code" actions. It declares `requires: [sshd]`, so the SSH server is installed automatically. No backend is pre-installed inside the container — VS Code downloads its own server component on first connect.

**Host prerequisite**: install the [Remote - SSH](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-ssh) extension in VS Code.

```yaml
name: tpl-java-vscode
parent: tpl-java
tools:
  - vscode-remote    # auto-installs sshd via requires
```

#### JetBrains IntelliJ (Gateway)

The built-in `idea-backend` tool installs the JetBrains IntelliJ IDEA remote development backend inside the container. It declares `requires: [sshd]`, so the SSH server is installed automatically.

**Host prerequisite**: install [JetBrains Gateway](https://www.jetbrains.com/remote-development/gateway/).

```yaml
name: tpl-java-ide
parent: tpl-java
tools:
  - idea-backend    # auto-installs sshd via requires
```

The `idea-backend` tool accepts a `memory` parameter to control the JVM heap size (default `2g`). Use the map form to customize it:

```yaml
tools:
  - idea-backend:
      memory: "8g"
```

### Terminal Session Persistence (zmx)

[zmx](https://zmx.sh) provides session attach/detach for the terminal — persistent shell sessions that survive disconnections, with native scrollback and multi-client support. Unlike tmux, it delegates window management to your OS rather than reimplementing it.

```yaml
name: tpl-agent
parent: tpl-dev
tools:
  - zmx
```

By default, `auto_attach` is enabled: shelling into the container automatically attaches to a persistent zmx session named `isx`. To install zmx without auto-attaching:

```yaml
tools:
  - zmx:
      auto_attach: "false"
```

On Linux, the container's zmx socket directory is shared with the host via a disk device. Container sessions appear in your native zmx socket directory with an `isx-` prefix — no configuration needed:

```bash
zmx list                              # shows isx-my-branch alongside local sessions
zmx attach isx-my-branch              # attach to the container's session from the host
zmx history isx-my-branch             # view scrollback from the container
zmx run isx-my-branch git status      # run a command in the container's session
```

All zmx commands work natively, including interactive `zmx attach`. On macOS, where Incus runs inside a VM, host-side socket sharing is not available. zmx sessions still work inside containers — `isx shell` (or Enter in the TUI) auto-attaches, and sessions persist across disconnections.

### Context Optimization (headroom)

The built-in `headroom` tool installs [Headroom](https://github.com/nicobrenner/headroom), a context optimization proxy for Claude Code. It runs as a local proxy on port 8787 that compresses conversation context, reducing token usage and improving response quality on long sessions. An MCP server is also registered with Claude Code for direct integration.

```yaml
name: tpl-agent
parent: tpl-java
tools:
  - headroom    # auto-installs claude via requires
```

The tool sets `ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL=http://localhost:8787` so Claude Code routes through the optimization proxy. The proxy runs as a systemd user service and starts automatically on container boot.

### Tool Parameters

Tools can define parameters for build-time configuration. Parameter types: `string` (with optional `pattern`), `integer` (with `min`/`max`), `boolean`, and `enum` (with `options`). Use `${param_name}` to reference values in scripts, env, and file content:

```yaml
# tools/my-server.yaml
name: my-server
parameters:
  memory:
    type: string
    default: "2g"
    pattern: "^[0-9]+[gGmM]$"
env:
  - name: SERVER_MEMORY
    value: ${param_memory}
```

Pass parameter values using the map form in image definitions (the `idea-backend` memory example above shows this pattern).

### Tool Actions

Tools can declare runtime actions that appear in the TUI (press **F9** on a running instance, or **Enter** to run the template's default action) and can be invoked from the CLI via `isx run <instance> --action <tool:action-id>`. Running `isx run <instance>` with no `--action` flag executes the template's default action. Actions can be declared in YAML tool definitions or programmatically by Java/CDI tools. The built-in `claude` and `pi` tools automatically contribute shell actions ("Claude Code" and "Pi Coding Agent") when included in a template's `tools` list.

Action entry fields:

- `label` (required) -- display text shown in the F9 menu; supports template variables
- `type` (required) -- one of: `url`, `command`, `shell`, `copy-to-clipboard`
- `id` -- stable identifier for referencing from `default-action: tool:action-id`
- `requires_running` -- whether the instance must be running (default: `true`)
- `expand` -- set to `repos` to generate one action per declared repository
- `auto_return` -- return to TUI automatically after the action completes (default: `false`; only meaningful for `command` and `shell`)

Type-specific fields:

- **`url`**: `url` -- URL to open in the host browser
- **`command`**: `command` -- shell command to run on the host
- **`shell`**: `command` -- command to run inside the container as an interactive terminal session
- **`copy-to-clipboard`**: `text` -- text to copy to the host clipboard

Template variables available in `label`, `url`, `command`, and `text`: `${ip}`, `${name}`, `${parent}`. When `expand: repos` is set, repo-specific variables are also available: `${repo_name}`, `${repo_path}`, `${repo_url}`.

```yaml
actions:
  - label: "Open repo '${repo_name}' in Gateway"
    type: url
    expand: repos
    url: "jetbrains-gateway://connect#host=${ip}&projectPath=${repo_path}"
  - label: "Launch agent"
    id: launch
    type: shell
    command: "my-agent --continue"
    auto_return: true
```

## Caching

The proxy and build system cache artifacts on the host, shared across all templates and branches. Only immutable, content-addressed artifacts are cached — mutable data (Maven SNAPSHOTs, repository metadata, version listings) always passes through uncached. Every artifact is verified against its content digest or upstream checksum before being committed to the cache; mismatches are discarded and re-fetched.

Proxy caches (from container traffic):

- **Container image layers** — OCI blobs from Docker Hub, GHCR, and Quay, keyed by SHA256 content digest
- **Maven and Gradle artifacts** — release JARs, POMs, and plugins from Maven Central and the Gradle plugin portal
- **Gradle distributions** — verified against the upstream `.sha256` sidecar

Build-time caches:

- **DNF packages** — host-side cache mounted during builds so child images reuse parent downloads
- **Tool downloads** — cached on the host by SHA256; rebuilds reuse unchanged artifacts

All caches live under `~/.cache/incus-spawn/`. There is no automatic eviction — every entry is content-addressed or version-pinned, so it is either correct forever or superseded by a newer version with its own entry.

## Roadmap

isx is evolving from a container manager into **mission control for parallel coding agents**: per-agent identities and audited commit signing ([#271](https://github.com/Sanne/incus-spawn/issues/271)), proxy-derived monitoring of agent status and spend, task dispatch, and an in-TUI review lane ([#322](https://github.com/Sanne/incus-spawn/issues/322)). Local-first stays the core conviction — your hardware, your network, your repos. See [docs/VISION.md](docs/VISION.md) for the full direction.

<!-- tabs:end -->

## Configuration

- `~/.config/incus-spawn/config.yaml` -- auth credentials and global settings
- `~/.config/incus-spawn/command-credentials.yaml` -- protected startup-only command-backed proxy credential rules
- `~/.config/incus-spawn/ssh/` -- managed SSH key pair, per-instance config, and known_hosts
- `~/.config/incus-spawn/images/*.yaml` -- user-level template definitions
- `~/.config/incus-spawn/tools/*.yaml` -- user-level tool definitions
- `.incus-spawn/images/*.yaml` -- project-local template definitions
- `.incus-spawn/tools/*.yaml` -- project-local tool definitions

The `config.yaml` also supports git remote auto-management via `host-paths` and `repo-paths` (see [Git Remotes](#git-remotes)), and a `searchPaths` list for loading templates and tools from external directories. Each directory should contain `images/` and/or `tools/` subdirectories following the same YAML schema as the built-in definitions. Tilde (`~`) expansion is supported for all path settings:

```yaml
searchPaths:
  - ~/my-templates
  - /absolute/path/to/templates
```

```
my-templates/
  images/
    quarkus.yaml
  tools/
    gradle.yaml
```

Resolution order (later sources override earlier ones with the same name):
1. Built-in (bundled with isx)
2. User (`~/.config/incus-spawn/`)
3. Search paths (in listed order)
4. Project-local (`.incus-spawn/`)

### Worker pools

A process can select a named worker pool with `ISX_POOL`. Pool selection is fixed for the life of the process; unset preserves the original single-VM behavior and every legacy path. A set value must name a valid entry in `config.yaml`, or the command exits before doing any work. Pool and reference names use lowercase letters, digits, and hyphens and must start with a letter; reference names are limited to 22 characters so `isx-reference-<name>` fits the virtio-fs tag limit.

```yaml
worker-pools:
  compile:
    cpus: 8
    memory-mib: 12288
    swap: 16G
    runtime-root: ~/isx/runtime
    workspace-root: ~/isx/workspaces
    reference-roots:
      maven: ~/.m2
      sources: ~/src-reference
```

Every field is required; `reference-roots` may be `{}`. Export paths must be absolute or start with `~/`, and roots may not duplicate, contain, or be contained by another root after canonicalization. The runtime and workspace roots are created when the pool is prepared; reference roots must already exist as directories. `runtime-root` and every reference root are read-only exports, while `workspace-root` is read-write. Paths containing a comma, newline, or NUL cannot be represented by vfkit's device syntax and are rejected.

```shell
ISX_POOL=compile isx vm start
ISX_POOL=compile isx
```

Named pools use their configured CPU, memory, and swap values, ignoring `ISX_VM_CPUS`, `ISX_VM_MEMORY`, and `ISX_VM_SWAP`. Their VM state and instance locks live under `~/.local/state/incus-spawn/pools/<name>/`, and each pool gets a deterministic locally administered MAC address. Configuration, credentials, CA material, proxy state and logs, appliance downloads, and caches remain shared globally.

Named macOS pools are demand-started. Installing the global proxy from a named-pool process does not register that pool, or the legacy whole-home VM, as a login service; it removes a stale `dev.incusspawn.vm` LaunchAgent if one exists. The proxy LaunchAgent stores no pool selection or credentials. It binds to an atomically persisted global VM-facing host gateway, so launchd can start it without an appliance connection. After starting another pool, apply that pool's complete current domain set without restarting the global proxy:

```shell
ISX_POOL=tests isx vm start
ISX_POOL=tests isx proxy configure-dns
```

On macOS, a named pool replaces the legacy whole-home share with one virtio-fs device per declared root. The guest mounts runtime at `/host/runtime` and references at `/host/references/<name>`, all read-only, and workspace at `/host/workspace`, read-write. Host paths used by resources, inboxes, repository references, and VM download staging must canonicalize beneath one of those roots; undeclared paths and symlinks that escape a root are rejected. Changing the resolved export plan while its VM is running requires `ISX_POOL=<name> isx vm restart` so host path translation cannot target mounts from a different launch.

Named pools require the companion incus-spawn vfkit fork, which extends `--device virtio-fs,...` with the `readonly` field and passes it to `VZSharedDirectory`. Upstream vfkit does not implement that field and named-pool launch fails closed. The guest also mounts read-only exports with `mount -o ro`, but that guest flag is defense in depth, not a substitute for the virtualization-layer restriction.

The pool mount layout also requires an appliance built from this fork. Development wrappers can set `ISX_APPLIANCE_DIR` to those artifacts and `ISX_APPLIANCE_VERSION` to the same opaque version embedded in `/etc/isx-version`; the latter keeps pool root-disk replacement deterministic without pretending a local appliance is an upstream release.

## FAQ

### Why can't I mount a host directory read-write to follow agent work in my IDE?

A project directory is not just data — it is an implicit code execution channel. Build tools, package managers, and IDEs all trust its contents and execute them with your full host privileges. A read-write mount turns the agent's output into unreviewed host-side code execution, which is exactly the threat model isx exists to prevent.

Two attack surfaces make this dangerous even for "just the project directory":

1. **Executable project content.** Build plugins, Makefiles, `gradlew`, `.mvn/jvm.config`, git hooks, IDE run configurations, and dependency declarations with local path references (`<systemPath>`, `file:` deps, Go `replace` directives) all execute when you run a normal build command. An agent that modifies a Maven build plugin or a git pre-commit hook gets code execution on your host with your credentials and network access — without you ever intentionally "running the agent's code."

2. **IDE auto-execution.** VS Code, IntelliJ, and most editors auto-execute project configuration the moment you open a directory: `.vscode/settings.json` (task auto-run), `.idea/` workspace files, ESLint/TypeScript/Pyright configs that load plugins. An agent writing to the project directory can trigger code execution on your host just by the folder being open — no build command required.

These risks are compounded by a **race condition**: with a live read-write mount, files can change between review and execution. You inspect a git hook or build script, decide it's safe, and run your build — but the agent modified the file between your review and your command. Unlike `git fetch`, which gives you a specific immutable commit to review and act on, a live mount means your review is never final.

Beyond security, a shared project directory is also **misleading**. The agent's code runs against the container's execution context — container-local SNAPSHOT dependencies, container-local `node_modules`, container-local pip packages. None of that comes through the mount. The source code on the host *looks* like a complete project, but when you build it locally it may behave differently or break entirely because the dependency state is invisible. The project directory is only a partial view of the agent's environment.

**What to use instead:**

- **`isx://` git remotes** ([Git Remotes](#git-remotes)): `git fetch <instance>` pulls a consistent, atomic snapshot — a specific commit you can review with `git diff` before merging. Even if the agent pushes new commits between your review and your merge, you act on the exact commit you reviewed. Git's content-addressed model eliminates torn reads by design. This is the intended workflow for getting work out of containers.
- **VS Code Remote SSH / JetBrains Gateway** ([Remote IDE Access](#remote-ide-access)): the IDE backend runs inside the container while the UI runs on your host. You see live edits, have full debugging, and the security boundary stays intact. Both are built-in tools (`vscode-remote`, `idea-backend`).
- **`readonly` and `overlay` host-resources** ([Host Resources](#host-resources)): for sharing files *into* the container safely. `readonly` is a read-only bind mount; `overlay` gives the container a writable view backed by an ephemeral layer, without modifying the host.

### `isx automation`

A versioned, non-interactive API for machine providers. It is available on Linux and macOS, never prompts, and does not emit `BuildOutput` formatting. The host and, on macOS, the appliance VM must already be initialized and running.

    isx automation <create|inspect|start|stop|mount|unmount|delete|exec> [options]

Lifecycle and mount commands emit exactly one JSON object on stdout. Every response includes `"protocol":"isx-automation"`, `"version":1`, `ok`, and `operation`. Successful responses also report `changed` and `exists`; an existing instance is represented only by the whitelisted `name`, `state`, `instance_type`, and `template` fields. Mount source and target paths are never added to the response or instance resource. Errors contain a stable `error.code` and a human-readable `error.message`; unexpected backend details are not returned.

```shell
isx automation create --name bb-worker-17 --template tpl-bb --key allocation-17
isx automation inspect --name bb-worker-17 --key allocation-17
isx automation start --name bb-worker-17 --key allocation-17
isx automation stop --name bb-worker-17 --key allocation-17
isx automation delete --name bb-worker-17 --key allocation-17
# Reconcile an allocation whose instance name was not durably recorded:
isx automation delete --key allocation-17 --template tpl-bb
```

`create`, `start`, `stop`, and `delete` are idempotent when the stored ownership key matches. `start` reports success only after every readiness command recorded by the source template succeeds; calling it for an already-running instance revalidates the same contracts. Mutations reject an instance owned by another key. Creation accepts only a stopped isx template on a same-pool CoW-capable storage pool; the new instance remains stopped. The copy request records `user.incus-spawn.automation-key` and its source template atomically, allowing a caller to reconcile a lost create response. A key-only delete succeeds unchanged when no allocation remains and fails closed if corrupted metadata maps the key to more than one instance. Key-only deletion requires `--template`; a matching key with another source template is rejected rather than deleted.

`mount` attaches a host workspace leaf to an owned running or stopped instance; `unmount` requires the same complete expectation before detaching it:

```shell
isx automation mount \
  --name bb-worker-17 --key allocation-17 \
  --device bb-workspace-17 \
  --source /srv/bb-workspaces/allocation-17 \
  --target /home/agentuser/work \
  --access read-write

isx automation unmount \
  --name bb-worker-17 --key allocation-17 \
  --device bb-workspace-17 \
  --source /srv/bb-workspaces/allocation-17 \
  --target /home/agentuser/work \
  --access read-write
```

The device name must start with a lowercase letter and contain at most 63 lowercase letters, digits, or hyphens. Source and target must be absolute, contain no `..`, NUL, or newline; the source must identify an existing physical path, and the target cannot be `/`. An existing instance-owned device is accepted only when its complete unexpanded Incus map exactly matches the translated source, target, access, and disk type; extra fields, malformed devices, and read-only/read-write changes are conflicts. A repeated exact mount and a repeated absent unmount are unchanged. Unmount rechecks the full expected map in the same Incus read-modify-write that removes the device, rather than deleting by name alone.

On named macOS pools, the physical source is canonicalized through the running VM's fingerprint-checked `VmHostExports` plan. Read-write attachment is limited to the declared workspace export; workspace leaves may be downgraded to read-only, while runtime and reference exports remain read-only. Symlink escapes, undeclared paths, and leaf aliases resolving to an export root fail closed. Incus receives the exact translated leaf, not the enclosing workspace root, and an inner `readonly=true` for read-only requests. Legacy macOS pools support read-only attachment only because the appliance mounts their whole-home share read-only; unlike named-pool read-only exports, that legacy restriction is not VZ-enforced.

`exec` accepts argv and environment as JSON rather than a shell command:

```shell
printf 'raw stdin\n' | isx automation exec \
  --name bb-worker-17 \
  --key allocation-17 \
  --argv-json '["printf","%s\\n"," empty and whitespace preserved "]' \
  --env-json '{"CI":"true"}' \
  --timeout-ms 300000
```

`--argv-json` must be a non-empty array of strings and is passed to Incus exactly, including empty, whitespace-only, dash-prefixed, quoted, and newline-containing arguments. No shell joins or reparses it. `--env-json` is optional and must be an object whose values are strings. UID and GID default to `1000`; cwd and `HOME` default to `/home/agentuser` and can be overridden with `--uid`, `--gid`, `--cwd`, and `HOME` in `--env-json`. Stdin is forwarded byte-for-byte and is never logged or included in protocol output.

Exec stdout and stderr are NDJSON frames containing base64 data, followed by one `result` or `error` frame:

```json
{"protocol":"isx-automation","version":1,"type":"stdout","data":"aGVsbG8K"}
{"protocol":"isx-automation","version":1,"type":"result","exit_code":0,"termination":"exited"}
```

A finite `--timeout-ms` or process shutdown (SIGINT/SIGTERM) requests `DELETE` on the Incus exec operation. The final error frame reports `termination` and whether operation deletion was attempted and accepted. Acceptance means only that Incus accepted the operation deletion request. Live macOS/vsock and Incus verification must still establish whether this kills the complete guest process tree; callers must not assume that stronger property until it has been verified.
