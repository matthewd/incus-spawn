# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

incus-spawn (`isx`) is a CLI tool for managing isolated Incus-based development environments. It creates full Linux system containers (not Docker-style app containers) with copy-on-write branching, a MITM TLS proxy for credential isolation, and an interactive TUI. See README.md for user-facing docs, DESIGN.md for architecture rationale, and [docs/CHARACTER.md](docs/CHARACTER.md) for the project's mission and design philosophy.

**Keep docs in sync**: When making architectural changes (new proxy capabilities, new tool types, new init steps, module structure changes, CI job changes, new intercepted domains, etc.), update both this file (and its `.claude/rules/` topic files) and DESIGN.md in the same PR. CLAUDE.md is the quick-reference for contributors; DESIGN.md is the full rationale. Both must stay current.

## Build and Test Commands

```shell
mvn package                    # Build both modules (CLI: cli/target/, proxy: proxy/target/)
mvn test                       # Unit tests only (no Incus required)
mvn verify -DskipITs=false     # Unit + integration tests (requires running Incus)
mvn test -Dtest=ToolDefTest    # Run a single test class
mvn test -Dtest=ToolDefTest#testAllFields  # Run a single test method

mvn package -Dnative -DskipTests           # GraalVM native binaries (isx + isx-proxy)

./install.sh                   # Build and install JVM version to ~/.local/bin/isx
./install.sh --native          # Build and install native binaries
```

## Tech Stack

- **Java 25**, **Quarkus 3.x** with aesh for CLI commands
- **Tamboui** for the interactive TUI (terminal UI framework)
- **Jackson YAML** for configuration/definition parsing
- **Quarkus CDI** for dependency injection (tool discovery, command wiring)

## Module Structure

Three Maven modules under a parent POM:

- **`common`** (`incus-spawn-common`): shared code -- Incus client, proxy config, image/tool definitions, configuration loading. Not a Quarkus app; uses the Jandex Maven plugin to produce a `META-INF/jandex.idx` so Quarkus discovers its CDI beans and `@RegisterForReflection` annotations from dependent modules.
- **`cli`** (`incus-spawn`): the main CLI/TUI binary (`isx`). Depends on common. Native image: serial GC, `-Os` (size-optimized), `-H:-AllowVMInternalThreads`,
  and on x86_64 `-march=haswell` (arch-gated in `cli/pom.xml`, same as the proxy). It downloads tool tarballs and VM images over HTTPS, and the default
  `x86-64-v3` omits AES/CLMUL: 79 MB/s vs ~3100 MB/s for AES-256-GCM. Binary size is byte-identical and startup ~11% faster, so it costs nothing here.
- **`proxy`** (`incus-spawn-proxy`): the standalone MITM proxy binary (`isx-proxy`). Depends on common. Native image: G1 GC, `-O3` (throughput-optimized, enables ML-inferred PGO), and on x86_64 `-march=haswell`.
  The `-march` value is set by arch-gated Maven profiles in `proxy/pom.xml` (empty on aarch64, where an x86 `-march` would fail the build).
  GraalVM's default `-march=x86-64-v3` omits AES and CLMUL, so the image cannot use AES-NI/GHASH intrinsics and TLS falls back to software AES --
  measured 73 MB/s vs 960 MB/s serving a cached Maven artifact (~13x). `haswell` costs no hardware support: AES-NI predates the v3 baseline by three
  years. `skylake` (+ADX) measures indistinguishably, so its narrowing is not worth taking. Do not "upgrade" this to `x86-64-v4`: the numbered levels
  never include AES, so v4 measures identically to v3 while dropping non-AVX-512 hardware.

Both `cli` and `proxy` are independent Quarkus applications that produce separate native binaries. When `isx-proxy` is not installed, `isx proxy start` falls back to running the proxy inline within the CLI process.

**bb gateway relay:** `bb.isx.internal` is a fixed built-in intercepted domain and must remain in certificate generation and every complete `proxy configure-dns` set. HTTP and WebSocket traffic for that exact host bypasses API body capture and all credential injection, relaying in plaintext to `127.0.0.1:18444`; preserve the original `Host`, caller `Authorization`, and `bb-host-daemon.v1` WebSocket subprotocol. HTTP bodies are streamed with backpressure and a 16 MiB declared-and-observed limit; reject ambiguous or malformed framing and abort both legs on failure. Return bb's nonretryable `invalid_request` JSON for oversized `/internal/session/events` batches so daemon delivery can bisect them; other oversized bodies use 413. Gateway WebSocket frame writes are serialized with backpressure in each direction. Vert.x synthesizes an `Origin` header by default: disable that on the trusted loopback leg, while rejecting an `Origin` or `Sec-Fetch-Site` received from the container. Never log its request target, URI, or query. ISX owns DNS/TLS/transport, while the bb host daemon owns authentication and authorization policy. Do not broaden this routing to subdomains or configurable tool entries.

**Command-backed proxy credentials:** Dynamic host commands belong only in the protected startup-only `~/.config/incus-spawn/command-credentials.yaml`; never add command execution to `ToolDef`, image definitions, or project YAML. Absence or `rules: []` disables it, while every other present file is strict and fail-closed on empty/malformed content, unsafe permissions, unsafe fields, or collision with a built-in or tool route. Rules target one exact lowercase HTTPS host on port 443 and provide unique bounded ID, absolute argv, configured one-line validation regex, exact inert Bearer and/or named raw-header placeholders, command/output/body/cache bounds, and generic health label/remediation. Run argv off the event loop without a shell or inherited environment, using only the fixed safe `PATH` and minimal runtime variables. Keep credentials in a generation-aware single-flight memory cache, throttle failures, drain/invalidate/retry one 401, bypass debug capture, and deny WebSockets. Rules and hosts are immutable for the proxy process and participate in certificates, routing, DNS, generic health, and Doctor; after edits, restart the proxy and run `isx proxy configure-dns`. Ordinary config reload must retain the startup-loaded rule set.

**Template security is declarative and exact-state:** `ImageDef.security` has independently inherited `sudo`, `nested-containers`, and `permissive-capabilities` booleans; root defaults are all false. `BuildCommand` clears inherited/pre-baked Incus privileged/idmap/nesting/setxattr/raw-LXC/tun state before a container's first boot, then recreates only explicit opt-ins. After trusted root setup and temporary mount removal it runs a fail-fast scrub of sudoers/group/subid/development-sysctl state and recreates selected guest privileges. VMs receive only the in-guest policy, never container-specific Incus settings. `tpl-minimal` and `tpl-bb` are hardened; `tpl-dev` explicitly preserves the privileged workstation/Podman behavior and `tpl-java` inherits it. Security affects definition fingerprints. Do not add branch-time privilege flags: policy belongs to templates.

**Automation API:** `isx automation create|inspect|start|stop|mount|unmount|delete|exec` is the version-one non-interactive surface on both platforms. Keep lifecycle/ownership/exact-device semantics in the transport-neutral `AutomationService`, wire format in `AutomationProtocol`, and Incus adaptation in `IncusAutomationTransport`; aesh classes only decode options. Mutations require `user.incus-spawn.automation-key`, creation puts ownership and source metadata in the initial same-pool CoW copy request, and key-only delete reconciles uncertain allocation. Mount/unmount accept only safe absolute source/target paths and Running/Stopped instances, inspect unexpanded own devices, and fail closed unless every Incus disk field matches; the mutation-side GET rechecks ownership/state and sends its ETag through `If-Match`, while unmount also passes the complete expectation into removal. Named macOS sources use access-aware, fingerprint-checked `VmHostExports` translation: only workspace may be read-write, and the translated leaf is never broadened to its export root. Lifecycle output is one-line versioned JSON without mount paths or raw backend details; exec is synchronized NDJSON with base64 stdout/stderr and exact JSON argv, raw stdin, and UID/GID 1000 plus `/home/agentuser` cwd/HOME defaults. Timeout or shutdown cancellation attempts Incus operation DELETE and reports whether it was accepted. Do not claim that this kills the complete guest process tree until live Incus and macOS/vsock verification confirms it.

**YAML tool downloads:** `ToolDef` download entries may set `extract`, `destination_file`, or both. Downloads are cached on the host, then either extracted into the target, copied to the exact destination path, or processed both ways. VM builds use mount-and-copy rather than slow incus-agent file pushes over vsock.

**Named worker pools:** `ISX_POOL` is captured once in `RuntimeConstants.WORKER_POOL`; unset is the exact legacy layout, while any set value is resolved through `SpawnConfig.loadStrict()` and must name a fully valid `worker-pools` entry. Do not add a mutable selector or route named selection through the forgiving `SpawnConfig.load()` fallback. Named VM state and per-instance locks live under `~/.local/state/incus-spawn/pools/<name>/`; config, credentials/CA, proxy state/logs and persisted macOS gateway, appliance artifacts, and caches remain global. Pool CPU/memory/swap override the legacy `ISX_VM_*` resource variables. `VmHostExports` is the canonical named-pool export/translation plan: runtime and references are separate read-only vfkit devices, workspace is read-write, and undeclared or symlink-escaping host paths must fail closed. VM download staging belongs under the runtime export; never broaden the devices to expose a cache or temporary-directory parent. A running VM's atomic export fingerprint must match at the common Incus API boundary and before translation. Named pools require the companion vfkit `virtio-fs,...,readonly` extension (which sets `VZSharedDirectory` read-only); upstream vfkit is unsupported, and guest `mount -o ro` alone is not a security boundary. Named macOS VMs are demand-started: proxy installation under a named selection must boot out/remove the legacy whole-home VM LaunchAgent, while unset retains it. The global proxy plist has an explicit validated persisted `--gateway-ip`, no `ISX_POOL` or credentials, and no Incus/vsock startup dependency. Prepare each additional selected appliance with `isx proxy configure-dns`, using the complete resolved proxy domain set and read-after-write verification. Local appliance builds set `ISX_APPLIANCE_DIR` and a matching safe `ISX_APPLIANCE_VERSION`; the latter must agree with the build's `/etc/isx-version` and the host root-disk marker.

**Native image: host paths belong in the run-time-initialized classes.** Quarkus initializes
application classes at image-build time unless they are listed in `--initialize-at-run-time`, and
Linux native builds run as **root inside the GraalVM builder container** — so a field holding an
`Environment` path bakes the builder's `/root/...` into the binary (that regression shipped: see
DESIGN.md "Build-time initialization must not capture host paths"). Eagerly resolved host state goes
in `RuntimeConstants` (`common`, including the immutable worker-pool selection) or `RuntimeServices`
(`cli`), both on the flag; everywhere else call
the `Environment` method instead of storing its result. The flag is declared three times (each
module's `resources-filtered/application.properties` plus `cli/pom.xml`'s `macos-native` profile) --
`NativeImageInitializationTest` fails if one drifts, and `graal/BakedHostPathFeature` fails the
native build if such a path reaches the image heap.

Detailed architecture docs are in `.claude/rules/` and load automatically when you work on related files. Each rule file declares `paths:` globs that trigger it. When adding new source packages, renaming files, or restructuring modules, check whether `.claude/rules/` path globs need updating -- stale paths silently stop loading context. Prefer package-level globs (`incus/**`) over specific files; use specific files only for cross-cutting triggers (e.g. `BuildCommand.java` in `incus.md` to ensure pool-awareness context loads during build work).
