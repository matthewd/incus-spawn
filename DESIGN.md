# incus-spawn Design Document

A CLI tool for managing isolated Incus-based development environments. System containers that behave like bare-metal Linux machines, designed for safely running untrusted AI agents and external reproducers in OSS projects.

## Why not Docker?

Docker and Podman are **application containers**: they isolate a single process with a minimal filesystem, no init system, and restricted networking. This is ideal for deploying microservices but poor for development environments where you need:

- A real init system (systemd) for services like podman socket, sshd, or dbus
- Full networking: `ping`, `traceroute`, `tcpdump`, DNS resolution that works like a real machine
- Nested containers: running Podman/Docker inside the environment (Testcontainers, CI pipelines)
- Debugging tools: `strace`, `perf`, `gdb` — all require capabilities or sysctls that Docker strips
- GUI applications via Wayland passthrough with GPU acceleration, and audio via PipeWire

Incus **system containers** run a full Linux userspace with their own init, networking stack, and process tree. They share the host kernel (like Docker) but present as a complete machine rather than a process jail. For stronger isolation, Incus also supports KVM virtual machines with a separate kernel, at the cost of a modest performance overhead.

The tradeoff: system containers are heavier than application containers (~200MB base vs ~5MB Alpine). This is acceptable for development environments that persist for hours or days, and copy-on-write storage means clones are cheap regardless of base image size.

## Goals

- **Secure by default**: isolated environments that prevent untrusted code from accessing host credentials or resources
- **Bare-metal experience**: containers with full init, real networking, working developer tools — developers shouldn't notice they're inside a container
- **Extensible without Java**: image definitions and tool installations defined in YAML; Java only needed for tools requiring programmatic logic
- **Ephemeral and cheap**: copy-on-write clones mean spinning up a new environment costs seconds and minimal disk space
- **Familiar**: CLI patterns inspired by git workflows (branch-name-style naming, auto-detection from cwd)
- **Idempotent setup**: `isx init` can be re-run safely at any time — each step checks whether its work is already done and skips without making changes, never disrupting running containers or reloading services unnecessarily. Init completion is tracked by a versioned sentinel (`~/.config/incus-spawn/.init-complete` containing `INIT_VERSION`). When `INIT_VERSION` is bumped (new infrastructure step added), existing installations automatically re-run init on the next command. On Linux, init writes sysctl overrides (`/etc/sysctl.d/99-incus-spawn.conf`) to raise per-UID inotify limits (`max_user_instances=8192`, `max_user_watches=524288`), preventing inotify exhaustion when running many containers. The Template Search Paths step uses `gh` to auto-detect the user's GitHub identity and offer to fork/clone `incus-spawn-templates` — every failure path (no gh, no auth, API error) degrades gracefully to the existing manual flow

## Tech Stack

- **Java 25**, **Quarkus 3.x** with aesh for CLI commands
- **Tamboui** (https://tamboui.dev/) for interactive TUI (list view, modal dialogs, inline actions)
- **GraalVM native image** for optional zero-dependency distribution
- **JBang** for easy installation (`jbang app install isx`)

### Module Structure

Three Maven modules under a parent POM:

- **`common`** (`incus-spawn-common`): shared code — Incus client, proxy config, image/tool definitions, configuration loading. Not a Quarkus app; uses the Jandex Maven plugin to produce a bean index so Quarkus discovers its CDI beans from dependent modules.
- **`cli`** (`incus-spawn`): the main CLI/TUI binary (`isx`). Depends on common. Native image: serial GC, `-Os` (size-optimized).
- **`proxy`** (`incus-spawn-proxy`): the standalone MITM proxy binary (`isx-proxy`). Depends on common. Native image: G1 GC, `-O3` (throughput-optimized), and on x86_64 `-march=haswell` — see "Native image CPU baseline" below. When `isx-proxy` is not installed, `isx proxy start` falls back to running the proxy inline within the CLI process.

## Architecture

### Container Model

- **System containers** by default (lightweight, full init system), with `--vm` flag for KVM VMs (stronger isolation, separate kernel)
- Containers are hardened by default. Templates opt into passwordless sudo, nested-container support, and retained capabilities/relaxed development sysctls independently through their inherited `security` policy
- No GUI by default; Wayland + GPU passthrough available at branch time
- Three network modes at branch time: full internet (default), proxy-only, or airgapped
- Container user: non-root `agentuser` (UID 1000), without sudo unless the template explicitly enables it

### Template Image Hierarchy

Images are defined in YAML and layered via copy-on-write. Built-in definitions live in `src/main/resources/images/*.yaml`; user-defined images in `~/.config/incus-spawn/images/` can extend or override them:

```
tpl-minimal   (hardened base OS only — no tools)
  ├── tpl-bb    (hardened Git/curl/Node.js/npm bootstrap host)
  └── tpl-dev   (privileged Podman, GitHub CLI, Starship, tmux)
        └── tpl-java  (JDK packages + Maven tool)
```

No coding agent is included in built-in templates by default — users add the ones they need to custom image definitions. Available Java tools: `claude` (Claude Code), `codex` (Codex CLI, behind the `openai` feature flag), `pi` (Pi coding agent), `bob` (Bob Shell).

Each image definition specifies:
- `name` — container name (required)
- `description` — human-readable description for the TUI
- `image` — base OS image, only for root images
- `image_url` — download URL for the base image tarball (supports `{arch}` and `{tag}` placeholders)
- `image_tag` — release tag identifying the base image version
- `image_sha256` — per-architecture checksums for integrity verification
- `type` — instance type: `container` (default), `vm`, or `kvm`. Inherits through the parent chain via `inheritTypes()` at load time
- `vm_image_url` — download URL for the VM base image (qcow2 tarball, supports `{arch}` and `{tag}` placeholders)
- `vm_image_sha256` — per-architecture checksums for the VM base image
- `parent` — parent image name (omit for root images)
- `security` — independently inherited `sudo`, `nested-containers`, and `permissive-capabilities` booleans
- `packages` — dnf packages to install
- `tools` — tool names to run (resolved from YAML or Java)

Every root security field defaults to false. Children inherit omitted fields and can explicitly disable a privilege enabled by a parent. The effective policy is part of the definition fingerprint, so policy changes make built templates out of sync. Image parsing is strict, including the nested `security` object, to prevent misspelled policy keys from silently producing a different security posture.

Building an image automatically builds missing parents recursively. `isx build --all` rebuilds every defined image from scratch. `tpl-dev` explicitly enables all three security options to preserve the upstream workstation and rootless-Podman behavior. `tpl-bb` derives directly from `tpl-minimal`, carries only Git, curl, Node.js 22.19+ and npm prerequisites for bb host bootstrap, and does not install a provider tool or credentials.

**Base image**: The root image (`tpl-minimal`) uses a custom Fedora base image
from [`Sanne/incus-spawn-images`](https://github.com/Sanne/incus-spawn-images)
instead of linuxcontainers.org. This image is a pre-baked systemd rootfs with
agentuser, systemd-networkd, a connectivity watchdog, container-specific service
masking, and a tmpfiles override for device node permissions — all the static
setup that `buildFromScratch` would otherwise perform on every build. A separate
VM base image (`vm_image_url`) is also available — a stock Incus Fedora VM image
customized with the same base configuration via `virt-customize`. A base image
tag and SHA256 checksums are baked into `src/main/resources/images/minimal.yaml`,
but they are only an **offline fallback**: when the base image is unpinned,
`BuildCommand.resolveTrackedBaseImage()` fetches the newest release from the
GitHub API at build time (via the shared `baseimage/BaseImageReleases`, whose
owning repo is parsed from the definition's `image_url` — the YAML is the single
source of truth, and a non-GitHub URL is simply not tracked) and swaps
in its tag + per-arch container/VM checksums, so a plain `isx build tpl-minimal`
always installs the latest base image. Any failure to reach or read the release
list leaves the built-in tag in place and the build proceeds. An event-driven CI
job (`.github/workflows/update-base-image.yml`) keeps that built-in fallback from
drifting by opening a PR to bump it whenever the images repo publishes a newer
release: `Sanne/incus-spawn-images` fires a `base-image-released`
`repository_dispatch` (carrying the new tag and the container/VM checksums it just
computed), so this repo neither polls nor re-parses `SHA256SUMS`. A manual
`workflow_dispatch` re-derives the newest release from the images repo's release
list as a backstop if a dispatch is ever missed.

`isx update-base` manages the pin: it fetches the release list from the GitHub
API, retrieves per-architecture container **and VM** SHA256 checksums, and writes
a user-level override to `~/.config/incus-spawn/images/minimal.yaml` (`pinned:
true`) when pinning a specific version. `--latest` (or menu option 1) simply
removes that override, restoring build-time latest tracking — it does not itself
download anything. `BaseImageReleases.parseSha256Sums()` keys checksums by arch
and separates the `-vm.tar.xz` disk image from the `.tar.xz` container rootfs, so
a pin records the correct digest for each. See the [incus-spawn-images README](https://github.com/Sanne/incus-spawn-images#releasing-a-new-version)
for the full release process.

**Resolution order** (later overrides earlier): built-in YAML (classpath) → user-defined YAML (`~/.config/incus-spawn/images/`) → search paths (`searchPaths` in config.yaml) → project-local (`.incus-spawn/images/`). Definitions with the same name from a later source override earlier ones — this is the mechanism behind pinning and template customization, so it stays silent. But two files declaring the same `name:` *within the same directory* is always a mistake (typically a copy that forgot to update `name:`, which silently masks the file you think you are editing). `ImageDef.loadAllWithConflicts()` distinguishes the two: same-directory collisions become `NameConflict`s (listing every colliding file), cross-layer replacements become `LayerOverride`s. `isx build` refuses to build while any conflict exists and names the offending files; the TUI degrades to a status warning but still renders; `isx doctor` surfaces both (conflicts as warnings, overrides as informational notes). Both `ImageDef` and `ToolDefLoader` feed the same `LayeredDefinitions<T>` collector (`config/LayeredDefinitions.java`), which owns the per-directory collision/override bookkeeping and the `NameConflict`/`LayerOverride` record types — so the policy is defined once and applies identically to images and tools.

### Tool System

Tools define how software gets installed into template images. Two formats:

**YAML tools** (primary format) — declarative, no Java needed:

```yaml
name: maven-3
description: Apache Maven (latest 3.x)
run:
  - |
    MAVEN_VERSION=$(curl -s https://dlcdn.apache.org/maven/maven-3/ ...)
    ...
verify: mvn --version
```

Schema fields (all optional except `name`):
- `packages` — dnf install
- `downloads` — artifacts to download and cache on the host, then extract into the container or expose as a file, or both (with optional SHA256 verification and symlink creation)
- `requires` — list of other tool names that must be installed first (resolved transitively)
- `run` — shell commands as root
- `run_as_user` — shell commands as agentuser
- `files` — files to write (path, content, optional owner)
- `env` — environment variables written to `/etc/profile.d/isx-env.sh` (supports structured entries with merge strategies)
- `verify` — verification command (logged, non-fatal)

Execution order: packages → downloads → run → run_as_user → files → verify. Environment variables are collected centrally after all tools run.

**Environment variable system** (`EnvEntry` + `EnvResolver`): Env entries from the full template parent chain and all tools are collected by `BuildCommand.writeEnvFile()` into a single `/etc/profile.d/isx-env.sh`. Four strategies: `set` (unconditional), `set-if-unset` (conditional default), `prepend`/`append` (additive with separator). Conflict detection: two `set` entries for the same variable with different values fail the build with both sources named. Templates (`ImageDef`) can also declare env entries. Java tools participate via `ToolSetup.envEntries()`. Raw shell strings are still accepted for backward compatibility.

**Transitive dependency resolution** (`requires`): Tools can declare dependencies on other tools. During build, `resolveWithDeps()` performs a recursive depth-first traversal to build the full dependency graph. Circular dependencies are detected and reported. Auto-added dependencies are logged: "Auto-adding dependency: sshd (required by idea-backend)". Dependencies are installed before the tools that require them.

**Java tools** (fallback) — for tools needing programmatic logic beyond what YAML supports:
- Implement `ToolSetup` interface (`name()` + `install(Container, Map<String, String>)` + `envEntries(Map<String, String>)`)
- Discovered via CDI (`@Dependent`)
- Currently used by: `claude` (binary install + settings), `codex` (npm install + settings, behind `openai` feature flag), `gh` (dnf install), `pi` (npm install + settings), `bob` (npm install)

**Resolution order** (later overrides earlier): built-in YAML (`resources/tools/`) → user-defined YAML (`~/.config/incus-spawn/tools/`) → search paths → project-local (`.incus-spawn/tools/`). A YAML tool with the same name replaces any earlier definition. Two tool files declaring the same `name:` within one directory are a same-directory conflict, reported by `ToolDefLoader.conflicts()` and treated exactly like image conflicts (see the images section above). Java CDI implementations (`@Dependent` beans) are used as fallback when no YAML tool matches.

**Feature flags**: Tools can declare a `feature()` that gates them behind an opt-in `features` list in `~/.config/incus-spawn/config.yaml`. Tools gated behind a feature flag are excluded from init menus, build resolution, TUI actions, and credential validation unless the feature is enabled — or the corresponding credentials are already configured (implicit enablement). The first gated feature is `openai`, which gates the `codex` tool.

### Host Repo Refresh

Before building templates or running `isx update-all`, `HostRepoRefresh` fetches all host-side git repos that match repos declared in image definitions (using the same `host-paths`/`repo-paths` resolution as local cloning). This ensures the local-clone optimization uses current objects. Fetches run in parallel and are rendered with the shared `TerminalProgress` animated per-repo spinner display (same helper used for parallel repo cloning). Optionally, missing repos can be cloned — the first prompt accepts `y`/`n`/`always`/`never`, with `always` and `never` persisted to the `auto-clone-repos` config field. `--skip-git-refresh` bypasses the refresh entirely. `update-all` only fetches (no clone prompts).

### Build Flow

**`buildFromScratch` (root image, no parent):**
1. Import and create the base instance while stopped (the bundled image is pre-baked with agentuser, systemd-networkd, and service masks)
2. Replace pre-baked Incus security state with the effective declarative policy — *skipped for VMs*
3. Start the instance and install the MITM proxy CA certificate
4. Prepare the running container for package install (tmpfiles overrides, temporary DHCP network config, man dirs) — *skipped for VMs*
5. Configure DNS (disable systemd-resolved, point at Incus bridge gateway)
6. Upgrade system packages
7. Install image-defined packages via dnf
8. Install image-defined tools (resolved from YAML/Java)
9. Clone declared repos (with reference optimization — see below)
10. Configure terminal title (`PROMPT_COMMAND` in `.bashrc` sets `isx:<hostname>`)
11. Pre-trust cloned repo directories in `.claude.json` (if Claude Code is installed)
12. Apply the in-guest security policy after all trusted root build work, scrubbing stale sudo/group/subid/sysctl state before recreating explicit opt-ins
13. Clean caches (dnf, /tmp)
14. Tag metadata (version, SHA, definition fingerprint, CA fingerprint, build source), stop

**VM-specific build behavior:**

When `type` is `vm` or `kvm` (set in the definition or via `--type`), `buildFromScratch` applies the entire ancestor tool/package chain from YAML definitions alone — parent Incus instances are not needed, so container parent rebuilds are skipped when a type change is detected in `buildChain`. Additional differences:

- **Base image**: uses `vm_image_url` (pre-baked VM qcow2) when available, falls back to a stock Incus VM image otherwise
- **Disk expansion**: runs `growpart` + `resize2fs`/`xfs_growfs` before package install (both for pre-baked images that ship at 10G and the final build which defaults to 100G)
- **Security config**: container-specific security settings (raw.idmap/idmap size, nesting, setxattr interception, raw LXC capability retention, and tun device) are skipped — VMs have their own kernel. The in-guest user/sudo/subid/sysctl scrub still runs
- **No restart**: container security is applied while stopped before first boot; VMs have no equivalent restart step
- **Tool downloads**: large file pushes over vsock are slow, so `YamlToolSetup` uses a mount-and-copy strategy for both extracted archive and downloaded files exposed via `destination_file`
- **KVM passthrough**: when `type: kvm`, `/dev/kvm` is passed through to the VM for nested virtualization

**`buildFromParent` (derived image):**
1. Copy the parent image and replace its Incus security state with the child's effective policy while stopped
2. Start and wait for network
3. Install image-defined packages via dnf (deduplicated — see below)
4. Install image-defined tools (with transitive `requires` resolution)
5. Apply the final in-guest security policy, clean caches, tag metadata, and stop

Security finalization is exact-state, not additive. For every container build, isx first unsets `security.privileged`, `security.nesting`, `security.syscalls.intercept.setxattr`, `raw.lxc`, `raw.idmap`, and non-default `security.idmap.*` values and removes the `tun` device, then recreates only settings selected by the effective policy. After package/tool/repository setup has completed as trusted root work and temporary host mounts are detached, the fail-fast in-guest pass removes `/etc/sudoers.d/agentuser`, `agentuser` membership in `wheel`/`sudo`, its `/etc/subuid` and `/etc/subgid` entries, and `/etc/sysctl.d/99-dev-container.conf`, then recreates only opted-in state. This ordering prevents a permissive parent, pre-baked image, or build-time tool from leaking privilege into a hardened child.

**Package deduplication**: Before installing packages, the build walks the parent chain and collects all packages from ancestor images and their tools. These are subtracted from the current image's package list so derived images only install what's new. The build logs both the count being installed and the count already present in ancestors.

**DNF cache sharing**: During builds, a persistent cache is mounted into the container at `/var/cache/libdnf5` so downloaded RPMs and metadata are reused across builds. On Linux, the cache is a host-side directory (`~/.cache/incus-spawn/dnf`) attached via a disk device with UID shifting. On macOS, a custom Incus storage volume (`dnf-cache`) is used instead, since the VM boundary prevents direct host-path read-write mounts. The package **install/upgrade** paths (and the VM rootfs dependency install) use `--setopt=keepcache=true` so downloaded RPMs persist, `--setopt=metadata_expire=3600` (1 hour) so repeated builds within that window skip metadata downloads, and `--setopt=max_parallel_downloads` (scaled to `CpuInfo.logicalCores()`, capped at dnf's practical max of 20) to parallelize the download phase — the rpm transaction itself is serial. These shared flags are centralized in `BuildCommand.DNF_BASE_OPTS` and spliced on by `dnfCommand(...)`. Repo-management calls that download nothing (`dnf copr enable`, `dnf clean`) run plain `dnf` — the cache/download flags don't apply to them. The cache device is unmounted before the final cleanup step so the image stays small. `isx clean cache` wipes the cache on both platforms — the host directory on Linux and the storage volume on macOS (via `IncusClient.deleteStorageVolume`). The volume is automatically recreated by the next build.

**DNF failure recovery**: All DNF install/upgrade commands are wrapped in `runDnf()`, which retries once on any failure: it runs `dnf clean metadata` to clear potentially stale repo data, then retries with `--refresh` to force fresh metadata from a (potentially different) mirror. This handles transient mirror issues like packages appearing in metadata before their signatures are available, without requiring manual intervention.

**DNF output**: dnf steps render a single animated `TerminalProgress` spinner line — the same braille-spinner helper used for parallel repo cloning — rather than streaming dnf's verbose per-package output to the terminal, keeping isx's own warnings and caveats visible instead of scrolling off in a flood. Install/upgrade (`runDnf`) stream dnf's output through a parser instead of echoing it: dnf5's non-TTY output emits one `[N/M] <action> <package>` line per completed step in both the download and transaction phases, so the spinner shows live "N/M — current package" feedback parsed from dnf's own progress lines. (dnf has no dedicated single-line progress mode; `--quiet` would suppress exactly those lines, so parsing the native output is the only way to get live feedback.) dnf's non-TTY column truncates each NEVRA's version/arch tail and the width can't be raised (`COLUMNS`/`terminal_width` are ignored without a TTY; a PTY widens it but replaces the tidy per-line output with concurrent ANSI progress-bar redraws), so `shortenNevra` reduces each `name-epoch:ver-rel.arch` to its bare package name for the live label. The streaming-without-echo path is `Container.execLines` → `IncusClient.shellExecStreaming` → `util/LineOutputStream`. COPR-enable and VM rootfs-expansion use `runWithSpinner` with captured exec (single/short operations that don't warrant a parser). On failure, the full output is printed to stderr after the animated line (so it doesn't interleave with the live display); the `--refresh` retry is surfaced as a live "retrying with --refresh" sub-line.

### Branching

Like `git branch`, branching creates an instant copy-on-write clone of any template image. Each branch has its own independent filesystem -- changes in one branch cannot affect the template image or any other branch. The CoW storage backend (btrfs/zfs/lvm) deduplicates unchanged data transparently at the block level, so branches are instant to create and only consume disk space for their own modifications.

**Static IP assignment**: Each branch receives a deterministic static IP on the bridge subnet at creation time. `StaticIpAllocator` scans all existing instances for claimed `ipv4.address` values on NIC devices and picks the lowest free host address (`.2`–`.254`). The IP is set on the Incus NIC device (so Incus is authoritative) and a `systemd-networkd` `.network` file is pushed into the stopped container before start, so the interface comes up statically at boot with no DHCP lease to expire. Templates do not have baked-in addresses — all CoW branches share the template filesystem, so a static address in the template would collide. The base image (from `Sanne/incus-spawn-images`) provides `systemd-networkd` and bakes in a connectivity watchdog (30s systemd timer) that detects IP loss after host sleep/wake and restarts `systemd-networkd` to recover; `isx` only supplies the per-branch address.

**VM deferred file pushes**: File push to a stopped VM is not possible (it requires the running `incus-agent` inside the VM). For VMs, `BranchCommand` and `ListCommand` skip pre-start file pushes (network config, SSH keys, terminfo) and instead call `InstanceLifecycle.pushDeferredVmFiles()` after starting the VM and waiting for the agent to become ready. The network config (IP and gateway) is read from Incus metadata at push time.

The TUI branch modal supports:
- Custom name
- GUI and audio passthrough (Wayland + PipeWire + GPU)
- Network mode selection (full internet / proxy-only / airgapped) via three-state radio
- Inbox mount (read-only host directory for sharing files into the container)
- VM resource limits (CPU, memory, disk)

### Versioned Automation Surface

`isx automation` is the non-interactive API for machine providers. The shared command group is registered in both platform command trees and exposes `create`, `inspect`, `start`, `stop`, `mount`, `unmount`, `delete`, and `exec`. It deliberately does not call the interactive init path, prompt, or use `BuildOutput`; an automation caller must arrange host initialization and appliance startup before invoking it.

The aesh classes only decode flags and select streams. `AutomationService` owns lifecycle validation, ownership, idempotency, and reconciliation behind the transport-neutral `AutomationTransport` interface. `AutomationProtocol` owns the version-one JSON and NDJSON representation. `IncusAutomationTransport` is the adapter to `IncusClient`. Unit tests therefore exercise protocol and lifecycle semantics with in-memory transports rather than reproducing those semantics in command fields.

Every automation allocation has a caller-supplied key in `user.incus-spawn.automation-key` and its source in `user.incus-spawn.automation-template`. Creation accepts only a stopped instance tagged as an isx base/project template and requires `planCopy()` to select the source's same CoW pool. The initial Incus copy request contains the ownership key, source, clone type, parent, and creation time, rather than patching them after creation. A lost response can consequently be reconciled by inspecting the committed copy. Existing names are accepted only when both key and source match; all other collisions fail closed. Start and stop accept only their normal opposite state, with the desired state as an idempotent no-op. Delete may identify the allocation by key alone, treats no match as an idempotent success, and rejects duplicate-key metadata rather than choosing an arbitrary instance. Inspect serializes only name, normalized state, container/VM type, and source template.

Mount and unmount take the owned instance, a restricted deterministic device name, an absolute physical host source, an absolute non-root container target, and `read-only` or `read-write`. `AutomationService` rejects line/NUL delimiters, relative or `..` paths, unsafe names, ownership mismatch, and states other than Running or Stopped before device mutation. The transport inspects only the instance's own unexpanded `devices`, classifies absence separately from malformed and conflicting entries, and compares the entire device object. The exact expected Incus object is `type=disk`, the translated source leaf, `path=<target>`, and, only for read-only access, `readonly=true`; additional fields also conflict. Mount is unchanged only for that exact object. Unmount is unchanged when absent, but an existing object must match every expected field before the same read-modify-write removes it. A device selected by name alone is never removed. Mutation rechecks ownership, state, and the own-device map on a fresh instance GET, then sends the returned ETag in `If-Match`; a concurrent config/device change therefore fails its precondition instead of being overwritten by stale state.

For named macOS pools, the adapter requests an access-aware `VmHostExports.Translation` after checking the persisted running-plan fingerprint. Translation canonicalizes through the longest containing export: read-only can use workspace, runtime, or reference roots, while read-write is accepted only under the workspace export. A leaf alias that canonicalizes to an export root is rejected so translation cannot broaden a narrow request to the complete workspace. Symlink escapes and undeclared paths remain errors. The translated appliance leaf is the Incus disk source; the outer runtime/reference shares remain VZ-enforced read-only, while the inner Incus `readonly=true` is defense in depth. The legacy macOS whole-home share can satisfy read-only mounts only because the appliance mounts it with `-o ro`; its vfkit export is not VZ-enforced read-only, unlike named runtime/reference exports. Legacy translation canonicalizes an existing source and rejects anything outside the exported home so a physical host path can never be misinterpreted as an appliance-local path.

Lifecycle replies, including mount and unmount, are one-line JSON envelopes with `protocol: "isx-automation"` and `version: 1`. Their instance resource remains limited to name, normalized state, container/VM type, and source template: host and container paths are not public fields, and raw backend errors are not serialized. Exec is NDJSON: synchronized stdout/stderr writers base64-encode each binary payload, followed by one result or error frame. `--argv-json` is parsed as a non-empty string array and passed directly to the Incus exec `command` array; no shell joins it. Environment values are also string-only JSON. Defaults are UID/GID 1000 and cwd/HOME `/home/agentuser`; stdin is relayed as bytes and is never logged or echoed.

The automation exec path is separate from the existing capture, streaming, bidirectional, and PTY wrappers. It retains `/wait` as the authoritative normal completion signal but uses one-second wait slices so a caller timeout or external cancellation is observed promptly. Either termination path makes one best-effort `DELETE` request against the Incus operation and returns a structured `TIMEOUT` or `CANCELLED` outcome carrying whether the daemon accepted deletion. The CLI registers a JVM shutdown hook so SIGINT/SIGTERM can trigger that same action. This is intentionally not reported as proof that every descendant process died: live Incus verification, including the macOS/vsock path, must confirm that operation deletion kills the complete guest process tree before a provider relies on that property.

### Terminal Output Visual Language

All multi-step human-facing command output follows a consistent visual language, centralized in
`BuildOutput` (`common/.../util/BuildOutput.java`). All output helpers live
there; individual commands should not define their own ANSI constants or
formatting patterns. Beyond build/branch, this governs the other lifecycle
commands too — `vm` (start/stop/resize), `destroy`, `update-all`, `update-base`,
and `project` — plus the shared `VmManager`. `isx init` keeps its dedicated
interactive style; `isx automation` is the other deliberate exception because
its stdout is a versioned machine protocol and must never contain decoration.

**Structure:**

- **Section** (column 0): `Refreshing 8 host repos:` or `Updating 6 template(s).`
  via `section(msg)`. Introduces a block of work at the left margin, preceded by a
  blank line. Use for top-level groupings; individual operations within a section
  get `header()`.
- **Header** (bold bullet): `  ● Building tpl-dev  [1/3]`, `  ● my-branch  ← tpl-dev`,
  or the generic `  ● Resizing VM data disk` via `header(msg)`. Identifies the
  top-level operation. Preceded by a blank line.
- **Step** (4-space indent): `    Configuring network...` — a complete line for
  fast or informational actions.
- **Step-start / step-done** (inline completion): `    Starting container... done.`
  — for slow operations, `stepStart` prints without a newline, work runs, then
  `stepDone` appends ` done.\n`. Use `stepDone(detail)` to report a result value
  inline instead of on a second line — `    Extracting root disk... done (4.0G).`.
  On error, `stepBreak` closes the line before the error message. Never print a
  `Doing X...` line whose result lands on a *separate* line — complete it inline.
- **Note** (dim, 4-space indent): informational messages that should be visible
  but not alarming — e.g. `    Parent 'tpl-dev' already up-to-date, skipping.`
  Uses ANSI dim (`\e[2m`).
- **Warning banner** (yellow borders, stderr): `warnBanner(title, lines...)` for
  diagnostic warnings that need to stand out — subnet conflicts, CA mismatches,
  firewall issues. Title is bold yellow, body lines are plain. Distinct from
  `warn()` which is a single inline yellow line within step output.
- **Success** (green checkmark): `    ✓ my-branch is ready.` — final confirmation,
  preceded by a blank line.

**Headers live in commands, steps in shared helpers.** A shared operation that
runs both standalone and nested (e.g. `VmManager.start()`/`stop()`, called both by
`isx vm start` and as sub-steps of `isx vm resize`) emits only steps/notes and
never its own header. The command class prints the one `● Header`; the shared
method's steps then indent correctly under whichever header the caller printed, so
no duplicate or nested headers appear. Where a shared step would otherwise repeat
the header verbatim, reword it (the stop step reads `Shutting down VM...` under a
`● Stopping VM` header).

**Warnings and errors** go to stderr. Notes (dim) are for expected conditions the
user may want to know about (skipped steps, cache hits). Warnings (`System.err`)
are for conditions that may need action. The distinction: a note is "this is fine,
FYI"; a warning is "you should look at this."

**Container commands during build:** tool `run:` and `run_as_user:` scripts
use `Container.runQuiet()`/`runAsUserQuiet()`, which capture output and only
print it on failure. This prevents leaked output (e.g. systemd's "Created
symlink" lines) from breaking alignment. `runInteractive` is reserved for
commands that genuinely need live terminal output (e.g. interactive shells).

**Adding new output:** use `BuildOutput.section()` to introduce a block of work,
`header()` to frame a named multi-step operation within it, `step()` for quick
actions, `stepStart()`/`stepDone()`/`stepDone(detail)` for slow ones, `note()` for
informational dim messages, `warnBanner()` for bordered stderr warnings, and
`success()` for the final confirmation. Do not add raw `System.out.println()` with
inline ANSI escapes, and do not leave a `Doing X...` line dangling. Pure
reports/tables and interactive prompts (e.g. `proxy` status, `clean` summaries,
the TUI) are not step sequences and stay as plain output.

### Worker-pool process selection

`ISX_POOL` selects one named worker pool for the lifetime of an `isx` process. There is no command-line selector and no mutable in-process switch: `RuntimeConstants.WORKER_POOL` captures the environment once in the run-time-initialized host-state holder. An unset variable preserves legacy behavior exactly. A set value takes the fail-closed path through `SpawnConfig.loadStrict()` before command dispatch, so an unsafe or unknown name, malformed YAML, an unknown pool field, or any invalid pool definition cannot fall through to the legacy VM.

Pools are declared under `worker-pools` in the global `config.yaml`. Each entry requires fixed `cpus` (at least 1), `memory-mib` (at least 2048), `swap` (the VM size syntax), `runtime-root`, `workspace-root`, and `reference-roots` (which may be empty). `WorkerPoolConfig` represents runtime and reference roots as `ReadOnlyExport` and the workspace as `ReadWriteExport`; the access mode is part of the type rather than a user-selectable string. Pool and reference names are restricted to lowercase alphanumeric/hyphen path-safe names.

`VmHostExports` turns those declarations into a resolved launch plan without consulting mutable process state. It expands `~`, canonicalizes the longest existing ancestor, requires every existing root to be a directory, creates only the controlled runtime and workspace roots, and requires references to exist already. It rejects canonical duplicate/nested roots. Translation canonicalizes the requested host path again and maps it through the longest containing root, so undeclared paths, dangling symlinks, and child symlinks escaping an export fail closed. vfkit's comma-separated device fields have no escaping convention, so commas, newlines, and NULs are rejected before argv construction. Reference names are limited to the 22 bytes left by the 36-byte virtio-fs tag limit, and the complete sorted kernel parameter is bounded to avoid command-line truncation. VM tool downloads that need a temporary Incus mount stage under the runtime root rather than broadening the plan to a cache or system temporary directory.

A named vfkit launch attaches runtime as `isx-runtime` read-only, workspace as `isx-workspace` read-write, and sorted references as `isx-reference-<name>` read-only. The appliance receives the sorted safe reference names on the kernel command line and mounts the devices at `/host/runtime`, `/host/workspace`, and `/host/references/<name>`; its `-o ro` flags mirror the runtime/reference virtualization flags. The virtualization restriction is authoritative: this requires the companion incus-spawn vfkit extension whose `virtio-fs,...,readonly` field passes `true` to `VZSharedDirectory`. Upstream vfkit does not support the field and therefore fails named-pool launch rather than falling back to a writable export. A guest-only `mount -o ro` would not protect the host from a compromised guest and is not considered sufficient. With no named-pool marker, both vfkit argv and appliance boot preserve the historical `hostfs` whole-home export mounted read-only at `/host`.

A named pool owns `~/.local/state/incus-spawn/pools/<name>/`: root/data/swap disks, disk version, dummy initrd, PID, lifecycle lock, serial log, REST URI, Incus and agent sockets, export-plan fingerprint, appliance-skew marker, and vfkit app bundle all derive from that directory. The fingerprint is written atomically only after vfkit has started successfully and is removed on stop or stale-process cleanup. A process whose current resolved plan differs from a running VM's fingerprint must restart that pool before host-path translation. Its per-instance lock directory is `<pool>/locks`. The unset selection retains `~/.local/state/incus-spawn/` and `~/.cache/incus-spawn/locks` byte-for-byte. Global configuration and credentials, CA and leaf certificates, proxy locks/state/logs, persisted macOS gateway, appliance artifacts, support caches, and download caches stay outside the pool directory. This split lets several appliance VMs coexist without duplicating credentials or immutable downloads.

Named macOS appliances are demand-started. A proxy install selected through `ISX_POOL` never writes or bootstraps the historical `dev.incusspawn.vm` login LaunchAgent; it boots out and removes a stale copy so the legacy whole-home VM cannot return at login. The unset selection retains that LaunchAgent behavior. The `dev.incusspawn.proxy` LaunchAgent remains a global singleton: installation discovers the selected running VM's private host-side bridge address, atomically writes it to global proxy state, and emits an explicit `--gateway-ip` argument. The plist contains neither `ISX_POOL` nor credentials, and proxy launch/reload does not require an Incus/vsock connection. A valid persisted address permits reinstall while no appliance is reachable; installation fails rather than writing an unvalidated listener address when neither source is available. Uninstall removes both global launchd state and any stale legacy VM plist.

Named-pool VM resources come only from the validated pool entry; `ISX_VM_CPUS`, `ISX_VM_MEMORY`, and `ISX_VM_SWAP` remain legacy-only overrides. `ISX_VM_DISK` remains the data-disk size input because disk size is not part of this first pool schema. `isx vm status` prints the selected pool, fixed resources, and state directory. Each named pool receives a deterministic SHA-256-derived locally administered unicast MAC (first octet `02`); the historical `4a:53:58:00:00:01` is retained for the legacy VM. vfkit launch and DHCP lease discovery both use the selected address.

A source checkout may supply appliance artifacts through `ISX_APPLIANCE_DIR`. `ISX_APPLIANCE_VERSION` gives that local build an opaque version distinct from upstream releases; it is restricted to URL/path-safe version characters and becomes the root-disk sidecar identity. The appliance build must embed the same value in `/etc/isx-version`. This lets a fork replace a release appliance deterministically when its init or mount policy changes, without teaching development builds to masquerade as the latest upstream tag.

### Resource Limits (Adaptive)

Detected at branch time from host resources:

- **CPU**: `available_cores - 2` (host keeps 2 cores, minimum 1)
- **Memory**: 60% of total RAM
- **Disk**: 20GB root disk

Overridable via TUI branch modal (for VMs, all three fields are shown).

### Container Configuration

The default policy retains Incus capability dropping, has no nested-container idmap/tun configuration, and gives `agentuser` no sudo or subordinate IDs. Explicit options add only their corresponding state:

- **`sudo`**: `/etc/sudoers.d/agentuser` grants passwordless sudo. Group membership is not required.
- **`nested-containers`**: `security.nesting`, Linux setxattr interception, a 165536-ID map with UID/GID 1000 passed through, matching `agentuser` subuid/subgid ranges, and `/dev/net/tun`.
- **`permissive-capabilities`**: `raw.lxc = lxc.cap.drop =` and `/etc/sysctl.d/99-dev-container.conf` with:
  - `net.ipv4.ping_group_range = 0 2147483647` — unprivileged ping
  - `kernel.dmesg_restrict = 0` — read kernel logs
  - `kernel.perf_event_paranoid = 1` — perf profiling
  - `kernel.yama.ptrace_scope = 0` — strace/debuggers

**DNS**: systemd-resolved disabled, `/etc/resolv.conf` points at Incus bridge gateway (`incusbr0`), immutable via `chattr +i`.

**Terminal title**: The host terminal title is set to `isx:<containername>` during `isx shell` sessions (via OSC escape sequences) and restored on exit. Inside containers, `PROMPT_COMMAND` in `.bashrc` overrides Fedora's default title-setting to maintain the `isx:<hostname>` title. Claude Code's built-in terminal title override is also suppressed so the container name stays visible.

### SSH Key Management

incus-spawn manages a dedicated SSH key pair and per-instance SSH configuration so tools like JetBrains Gateway and `ssh` work without passphrase prompts or host key warnings:

```
~/.config/incus-spawn/ssh/
    id_ed25519          # managed private key (mode 600, no passphrase)
    id_ed25519.pub      # managed public key
    config              # per-instance Host blocks (managed by isx)
    known_hosts         # container host keys (isolated from ~/.ssh/known_hosts)
```

**Lifecycle:**

1. **`isx init`** generates the ed25519 key pair (via `ssh-keygen`) and prepends an `Include ~/.config/incus-spawn/ssh/config` directive to `~/.ssh/config` (idempotent, resolves symlinks for dotfile managers). The key pair is also created lazily at first branch for users upgrading from older versions.
2. **`isx branch`** (via `InstanceLifecycle.injectSshKeyIfAvailable`): injects both the managed public key and any personal `~/.ssh/*.pub` key into the container's `authorized_keys`. Then regenerates the container's SSH host keys (`ssh-keygen -A` + sshd restart) so CoW-branched instances get unique keys, harvests the new host public key into the managed `known_hosts`, and writes a `Host <instance-name>` block to the managed config with `HostName`, `User agentuser`, `IdentityFile`, `IdentitiesOnly yes`, `UserKnownHostsFile`, and `StrictHostKeyChecking yes`. After this, `ssh <instance-name>` just works.
3. **`isx destroy`** (and TUI delete): removes the Host block from the managed config and the host key entry from the managed known_hosts.

**Design decisions:**

- **Dual known_hosts**: the primary store is `~/.config/incus-spawn/ssh/known_hosts`, referenced via `UserKnownHostsFile` in the managed SSH config. Host keys are also written to `~/.ssh/known_hosts` because IntelliJ's built-in SSH client does not honor `UserKnownHostsFile` or `Include` directives — without the standard-file entry, IntelliJ Gateway prompts for host key confirmation on every connection. Entries in both files are cleaned up on instance destroy.
- **Host key regeneration**: CoW clones inherit the template's host keys, so all branches would share the same host key. `harvestHostKey` regenerates them before harvesting to give each instance a unique key.
- **Both keys injected**: the managed key (passphraseless) ensures tools always work, while the user's personal key is also injected so interactive SSH sessions can use their preferred key.
- **Atomic writes**: all config and known_hosts updates use temp-file-then-rename with restrictive permissions to avoid partial writes.
- **Non-fatal**: SSH setup failures never block init or branching — they warn and fall back to manual `ssh agentuser@<ip>`.

### Remote IDE Access

The built-in `idea-backend` tool installs the JetBrains IntelliJ IDEA remote development backend and registers the container for JetBrains Gateway discovery. It uses the `requires` field to automatically pull in the `sshd` tool, which configures an OpenSSH server with pubkey-only authentication. SSH key injection and host key validation are handled automatically by the SSH key management subsystem (see above), so Gateway connections work without any manual key setup. This enables IDE-based development inside containers: Gateway connects over SSH and runs the IntelliJ backend process inside the container, with the full project available.

### GUI and Audio Passthrough

Enables GUI applications and audio inside containers:
- GPU device passed through for hardware-accelerated rendering
- Host `XDG_RUNTIME_DIR` bind-mounted, exposing the Wayland socket and PipeWire/PulseAudio socket
- Environment variables written to `/etc/profile.d/wayland.sh` (`WAYLAND_DISPLAY`, `XDG_RUNTIME_DIR`, toolkit backends)

### Network Modes

Branches run in one of three network modes, selectable via CLI flags or the TUI branch modal:

**Full internet** (default): Container stays on the `incusbr0` bridge with NAT masquerading and a static IP assigned at branch time. Unrestricted outbound access to the internet. Traffic to intercepted domains (Anthropic, GitHub) is transparently authenticated by the host MITM proxy — credentials never enter the container in any form.

**Proxy only** (`--proxy-only`): Container stays on the bridge but iptables OUTPUT rules restrict all outbound traffic to the MITM proxy (port 443) and DNS. The container can only reach intercepted domains via the MITM proxy.

Container-side firewall rules:
```
iptables -A OUTPUT -o lo -j ACCEPT
iptables -A OUTPUT -m conntrack --ctstate ESTABLISHED,RELATED -j ACCEPT
iptables -A OUTPUT -d <gateway> -p tcp --dport 443 -j ACCEPT     # MITM proxy
iptables -A OUTPUT -d <gateway> -p tcp --dport 18080 -j ACCEPT   # Health check
iptables -A OUTPUT -d <gateway> -p udp --dport 53 -j ACCEPT      # DNS
iptables -P OUTPUT DROP
```

**Airgapped** (`--airgap`): Network device detached or removed. Complete network isolation — no egress at all.

### Auth & Security: MITM TLS Proxy

**API keys and tokens never enter containers.** A host-side MITM TLS proxy (`isx proxy`) provides transparent authentication. Placeholder values satisfy tools' local auth checks (e.g. `GH_TOKEN`, `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`), but the proxy replaces them with real credentials before requests reach upstream servers.

**How it works:**

1. The CLI configures bridge-level DNS overrides (via `raw.dnsmasq` on `incusbr0`) so all containers resolve intercepted domains to the gateway IP. `isx proxy configure-dns` writes and verifies the complete built-in, currently resolved tool-proxy, and startup-only command-credential set on the selected appliance without restarting the singleton proxy; named macOS pools use it after each demand start
2. Template images include a custom CA certificate (generated during `isx init`) so containers trust the proxy's TLS certificates
3. The proxy listens on port 18443 on the gateway IP. An iptables PREROUTING redirect rule (installed by `isx init` via `firewall-cmd --permanent --direct`) transparently redirects traffic arriving on `incusbr0` destined for port 443 to port 18443, avoiding conflicts with the Incus daemon on port 443. The proxy terminates TLS using per-domain certificates signed by the custom CA
4. Based on the target domain, the proxy injects authentication headers:
   - `api.anthropic.com` — `x-api-key: <anthropic-api-key>` (direct API key mode), `Authorization: Bearer <oauth-token>` (OAuth mode, for Claude Pro/Max subscriptions), or Vertex AI passthrough/translation with GCP Bearer token (Vertex mode, see below). Anthropic auth is hardcoded in `MitmProxy` (three auth modes with complex routing)
   - Tool-contributed domains (GitHub, OpenAI, Bob, and user-defined tools) — credential injection is declared in YAML tool definitions via `proxy:` entries (see "Tool-contributed proxy definitions" below)
   - Container registry, Maven, and npm domains — relayed transparently with caching (no auth injection)
   - `bb.isx.internal` — relayed without injection or body logging to plain HTTP/WebSocket on host loopback port 18444
5. The proxy re-encrypts and forwards normal intercepted traffic to the real upstream over TLS; the fixed bb gateway terminates at the loopback daemon

**bb gateway trust split:** `bb.isx.internal` is always in the built-in intercepted set, so normal certificate generation and `isx proxy configure-dns` cover it without tool configuration. ISX owns DNS, container-facing TLS, and transport to `127.0.0.1:18444`; it preserves the original `Host` for downstream policy and, for WebSocket handshakes, the caller's `Authorization` and `bb-host-daemon.v1` subprotocol. It deliberately bypasses generic tool credential injection and debug body capture. The HTTP relay has a dedicated streaming path: it rejects malformed or conflicting length/transfer framing, enforces 16 MiB against both a declared `Content-Length` and bytes observed in a chunked stream, applies backpressure in both directions, and resets the other leg when either side aborts. An oversized `/internal/session/events` batch receives bb's nonretryable `invalid_request` JSON so the daemon bisects it; other oversized requests receive 413. Gateway WebSocket writes are serialized per direction, with each source paused until the corresponding asynchronous frame write completes. Logs identify only `bb.isx.internal`, never its request target, URI, or query. The bb host daemon owns caller authentication and authorization; loopback is the plaintext boundary between the two host-side components. Its per-host `bbdh_` credential is agent-readable because both processes share the container account, so the downstream allowlist and bb's host/thread assignment checks—not daemon-only secrecy—bound that capability.

**Vertex AI support:** When the host is configured for Vertex AI (`useVertex=true` in config), containers run Claude Code in **Vertex mode** with `CLAUDE_CODE_USE_VERTEX=1`, `CLAUDE_CODE_SKIP_VERTEX_AUTH=1`, and `ANTHROPIC_VERTEX_BASE_URL=https://api.anthropic.com/v1`. This causes the Vertex SDK inside the container to send already-formatted Vertex requests (`/v1/projects/.../models/...:streamRawPredict`) to `api.anthropic.com`, which resolves to the proxy via dnsmasq. The proxy then forwards to the real Vertex endpoint with GCP credentials. No GCP credentials enter the container.

Running containers in Vertex mode (rather than standard mode) is required because Claude Code's model list depends on the provider: standard mode ("firstParty") shows a hardcoded subset that may omit newer models, while Vertex mode shows the full model catalogue. Using Vertex mode in the container ensures the `/model` picker matches what's available on the host.

**Three-way routing for Anthropic traffic:**

The proxy routes requests to `api.anthropic.com` through one of three paths based on the URL:

1. **Vertex passthrough** (`/v1/projects/...`): Requests already in Vertex format (from the container's Vertex SDK). The proxy strips `@date` model version suffixes from the URL (the global endpoint rejects them), removes the `anthropic-beta` header, injects a GCP Bearer token, and forwards to the real Vertex endpoint. The body is passed through unmodified — the Vertex SDK already formats it correctly.

2. **Standard-to-Vertex translation** (`/v1/messages`): Requests in standard Anthropic API format. The proxy buffers the body and translates to Vertex `rawPredict` format (see translation details below). This path is used if a container happens to send standard-format requests (e.g. from curl).

3. **Direct forwarding** (all other paths): Non-messages endpoints (settings, bootstrap, feature flags, MCP registry) are forwarded to the real `api.anthropic.com` with credential injection. These endpoints don't exist on the Vertex API.

**Standard-to-Vertex translation details** (path 2):

- URL: `/v1/messages` → `/v1/projects/{projectId}/locations/{region}/publishers/anthropic/models/{model}:rawPredict` (or `:streamRawPredict` when `stream=true`)
- Auth: replaces `x-api-key` with `Authorization: Bearer <gcp-token>` (obtained via `gcloud auth print-access-token`, cached ~50 minutes)
- Body: extracts `model` field and moves it into the URL path, stripping date suffixes (e.g. `claude-sonnet-4-6-20251001` → `claude-sonnet-4-6`)
- Body: adds `"anthropic_version": "vertex-2023-10-16"` (required by Vertex rawPredict)
- Body: strips all top-level fields not in the Vertex allowlist (beta features like `context_management` cause "Extra inputs" rejections)
- Body: recursively strips `scope` from nested `cache_control` objects (beta feature unsupported by Vertex)
- Header: removes `anthropic-beta` (Vertex rejects beta feature flags; features are enabled via `anthropic_version`)
- Host: rewrites to the Vertex endpoint hostname for the configured region

The body translation uses an allowlist approach: only known-good fields (`messages`, `system`, `max_tokens`, `temperature`, `top_p`, `top_k`, `stop_sequences`, `stream`, `metadata`, `tools`, `tool_choice`, `thinking`, `output_config`, `anthropic_version`) are kept. Everything else is dropped. This is more robust than blocklisting individual beta fields, since new Claude Code beta features are automatically stripped without proxy changes.

**Vertex AI protocol details** (learned from testing):

- **Hostname resolution by region**: The standard pattern is `{region}-aiplatform.googleapis.com` (e.g. `us-east5-aiplatform.googleapis.com`), but some meta-regions use special hostnames: `global` → `aiplatform.googleapis.com`, `us` → `aiplatform.us.rep.googleapis.com`, `eu` → `aiplatform.eu.rep.googleapis.com`
- **Model naming**: The Vertex SDK uses `@` for model version suffixes in URL paths (e.g. `claude-haiku-4-5@20251001`), while the standard API uses `-` (e.g. `claude-haiku-4-5-20251001`). The global Vertex endpoint only accepts short model aliases without any version suffix — both `@20251001` and `-20251001` forms are rejected. The proxy strips both forms.
- **Beta features**: The `anthropic-beta` header is rejected by Vertex rawPredict with "Unexpected value(s) for anthropic-beta header". This includes common beta flags like `claude-code-20250219`, `interleaved-thinking-2025-05-14`, `web-search-2025-03-05`, and `prompt-caching-scope-2026-01-05`. Features like extended thinking work without any beta flags on Vertex — they're enabled via `anthropic_version`. The Vertex SDK moves `anthropic-beta` header values into the body as an `anthropic_beta` array, but even that is rejected ("invalid beta flag"). The proxy strips the header entirely without adding it to the body.
- **Auth skipping**: `CLAUDE_CODE_SKIP_VERTEX_AUTH=1` causes the Vertex SDK to skip GCP authentication and return stub credentials that produce empty auth headers. The proxy then replaces these with real GCP tokens. A stub `/usr/local/bin/gcloud` is installed inside Vertex containers (by `ClaudeSetup`) that returns a placeholder token for `auth print-access-token` — this prevents Claude Code's periodic credential-refresh from failing after ~60 minutes. The proxy replaces the placeholder token with a real one anyway.
- **Base URL override**: `ANTHROPIC_VERTEX_BASE_URL` redirects all Vertex SDK requests to a custom endpoint. Setting it to `https://api.anthropic.com/v1` causes the container's Vertex SDK to send requests to `api.anthropic.com`, which resolves to the proxy via dnsmasq.
- **Response format**: Vertex `rawPredict` returns standard Anthropic response format — no response translation is needed.

**Pi coding agent support:** Pi is a provider-agnostic coding agent that always communicates via the standard Anthropic API (`/v1/messages`). Unlike Claude Code, Pi does not have a Vertex mode — it always sends standard API requests with an `x-api-key` header. The proxy handles both direct key injection and standard-to-Vertex translation transparently. No Vertex-specific environment variables are needed inside the container; `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-placeholder` is the only auth configuration (declared via `PiSetup.envEntries()`).

**WebSocket passthrough:** The proxy also handles WebSocket upgrade requests. When a client sends an HTTP Upgrade to a proxied domain, the proxy establishes a corresponding upstream WebSocket connection (injecting credentials on the initial handshake), then relays frames bidirectionally. The client socket is paused until the upstream connection is established to prevent frame drops. Keepalive pings are sent on both legs, and close codes are propagated. This is used by Codex CLI, which communicates with `api.openai.com` over WebSocket. The `bb.isx.internal` path instead opens plain WebSocket to `127.0.0.1:18444`, preserving caller authorization and the `bb-host-daemon.v1` subprotocol without injection; frame and ping writes on that path are serialized, and each source is paused until its destination write completes. Vert.x's client-generated `Origin` is disabled on this trusted loopback leg, while an `Origin` or `Sec-Fetch-Site` received from a container is rejected as browser-originated traffic.

**Intercepted domains:** Built-in: `api.anthropic.com`, `bb.isx.internal`, `registry-1.docker.io`, `auth.docker.io`, `ghcr.io`, `quay.io`, `repo.maven.apache.org`, `repo1.maven.org`, `plugins.gradle.org`, `services.gradle.org`, `registry.npmjs.org`, `rubygems.org`, `index.rubygems.org`. Tool-contributed (via YAML `proxy:` entries): `github.com`, `api.github.com`, `raw.githubusercontent.com`, `objects.githubusercontent.com`, `codeload.github.com`, `uploads.github.com`, `api.openai.com`, `bob.ibm.com` (and all `*.bob.ibm.com` subdomains). User-defined tools can add additional domains. Protected machine-local command-credential rules contribute exact hosts without making command execution part of the tool or project schemas.

**HTTPS only:** The proxy intercepts HTTPS traffic, so Git operations must use HTTPS URLs (not SSH). `gh` defaults to HTTPS automatically; for `git clone`, use `https://github.com/...` instead of `git@github.com:...`.

All other domains (package mirrors, PyPI, etc.) route normally via Incus bridge NAT and are unaffected by the proxy.

**Credential validation**: Building a template image that includes `claude`, `codex`, `pi`, or `gh` tools requires the corresponding credentials to be configured on the host. Both the CLI and TUI check this before starting a build and abort with a clear error if credentials are missing. Tools behind a feature flag that is not enabled are excluded from credential checks.

**Auth error reporting**: When credential injection fails the proxy records an `authError` and surfaces it on `/health`, which `isx proxy status`, `isx doctor` and the TUI banner all render. Injection only runs on real container traffic, so that latch alone makes the status wrong in both directions: it reports failures the user has already fixed, and reports nothing at all before the first API call of a session. The health endpoint therefore verifies the Vertex token itself, on a worker thread, before answering — clearing a stale error, or reporting a broken credential that no request has hit yet.

**Per-appliance DNS status**: The proxy process cannot attach one meaningful pool identity to its `/health` `dnsConfigured` field because it is global while appliance bridges are per pool. CLI/TUI status therefore verifies the exact IPv4 and IPv6-suppression lines for the complete current domain set directly on the selected bridge rather than accepting that global bit. `configure-dns` performs the same read-after-write verification. The raw `/health` field remains process-global for compatibility and is not evidence that every named appliance has been configured.

The checks it declines are what keep this cheap:

- **Vertex not in use** — returns immediately, before any lock or thread dispatch. A non-Vertex setup never invokes `gcloud`, and pays nothing.
- **A valid cached token with no standing error** — the steady state. Tokens are cached for 50 minutes, so a healthy Vertex install makes roughly one `gcloud` call per token lifetime regardless of poll rate.
- **A standing OAuth error** (hint `isx init`) — only the user can resolve it; running `gcloud` would prove nothing.
- **A check that ran within 10 seconds, or one in flight** — a failing credential caches nothing, so without this every poll from the TUI or `isx doctor` would fork a fresh `gcloud`.

A failure found by the health check is recorded via `recordProbeAuthError`, which never sends a desktop notification: the check runs on every poll, and the notification belongs to the traffic path where a failure actually blocks the user. The first transition is still logged. The `gcloud` invocation is bounded at 15 seconds and an empty token is rejected rather than cached — this path is now reachable with no container traffic to reveal a hang or a blank credential.

**Version drift detection**: The proxy health check (run before builds, branches, and shell access) compares the running proxy's version against the CLI version. If they differ: when no containers are running, the proxy is automatically restarted; when containers are running, a warning is shown with instructions to restart manually. This prevents subtle failures from CA certificate or protocol mismatches. **Tool proxy config drift** is detected via file modification times: the proxy records a timestamp at startup and after each successful reload, and on each `/health` request checks whether `config.yaml` or the `tools/` directory (and individual tool YAML files) have been modified since. This avoids the cost of re-parsing configuration on every health poll. The fingerprint-based approach (SHA-256 of resolved proxy config) is used for cross-process drift detection: the CLI recomputes the expected fingerprint from current tool definitions and config, and triggers a proxy restart when they diverge.

**CA certificate mismatch**: At branch time, `BranchCommand` compares the template's `ca-fingerprint` metadata against the current CA certificate. If they differ (e.g. after `isx init` regenerated the CA), a warning is shown suggesting to rebuild the template. This prevents TLS failures in branches where the container's trusted CA doesn't match the proxy's signing CA.

**Leaf certificate persistence (clock-skew safety)**: Per-domain leaf certs are not minted fresh on every proxy start. `CertStore` persists them under `~/.config/incus-spawn/certs/` (keyed by domain — `<domain>.crt`/`.key`, wildcards as `_wildcard.<domain>`) and reuses them across restarts, re-minting only when a cert is missing, was signed by a rotated CA, or is within 30 days of expiry.

This fixes an intermittent "certificate is not yet valid" failure. A cert's `notBefore` is stamped from the **host** clock at mint time, but it is validated against the **container** clock. These are independent clocks: on macOS the proxy runs on the Mac host (launchd, `KeepAlive=true`) while containers run inside an Incus VM whose clock can lag briefly after the Mac sleeps, before host/guest reconciliation completes. `KeepAlive` relaunches the proxy whenever it exits (including right after wake, when the Mac clock has already jumped forward to real time); re-minting at that moment produced a `notBefore` in the lagging container's future, failing validation with "certificate is not yet valid". No clock ever runs backward — both are monotonic — but the gap between the mint clock (host, ahead) and the validating clock (container, behind) can exceed a day. Reusing a persisted leaf keeps its original `notBefore` (stamped while the clocks were in sync), so the container's lagging-but-monotonic clock always accepts it. `CertificateAuthority.BACKDATE_MS` (2 days) backdates `notBefore` as a margin for the rare remaining fresh-mint moments (first install, CA rotation, near-expiry renewal). The underlying clock drift is corrected through `qemu-ga`: vfkit reconciles the guest against the Mac at startup, after wake, and during periodic checks, using fresh bounded-retry vsock connections. `chronyd` remains an independent network-dependent fallback (see `appliance/DESIGN.md`, Clock Synchronization). Cert persistence and backdating remain as defense-in-depth for the brief window before either synchronizer runs.

Certs are keyed by domain, never by container: a leaf is a function of `(domain, CA)` and is identical for every container that intercepts that domain. Planned per-container interception (a different intercepted-domain set per container) is a routing/DNS concern — it decides which domains reach the proxy for a given container — and does not change cert identity, so the store stays domain-keyed. The remaining work for that feature is to resolve certs per-SNI on demand against this same on-disk store rather than building a single JKS at start; the storage format does not change.

**Vertex AI token refresh**: Vertex AI requests that receive a 401 response are retried once with a fresh GCP access token (the cached token is invalidated). This handles token expiry during long-running sessions without user intervention.

**Command-backed credential injection:** `CommandCredentialConfig` reads only `~/.config/incus-spawn/command-credentials.yaml`. Absence and explicit `rules: []` disable the feature; every other present file must be a non-empty, owner-readable regular non-symlink file with no group or other permissions. Jackson duplicate detection and unknown-field rejection make the schema strict. IDs are unique bounded lowercase names. Hosts are unique exact lowercase DNS names and are unconditionally HTTPS/443; wildcard, scheme, and port configuration is intentionally absent. Startup rejects overlap with built-in routes, exact tool routes, and tool wildcard suffixes, including tool definitions whose credential is not currently resolved. This surface is deliberately separate from `ToolDef`, `ImageDef`, and project YAML, so an untrusted or project-scoped definition cannot cause host command execution.

A rule supplies absolute argv, one-line credential validation regex, exact inert placeholders for a Bearer `Authorization` carrier and/or one named raw header, command timeout/output bounds, HTTP body bound, positive and failure-cache TTLs, and generic health label/remediation. `CommandCredentialBroker` invokes argv directly off the event loop with stderr discarded and a cleared environment containing only `HOME`, `USER`, `LOGNAME`, `TMPDIR`, and the fixed safe system `PATH`; it never invokes a shell. It accepts one bounded UTF-8 stdout line matching the configured regex. Successful values remain only in a generation-aware single-flight memory cache, while failures use the configured negative-cache TTL. The request path requires at least one configured carrier with its exact configured placeholder, rejects a duplicate, unsupported, or non-exact carrier before command acquisition, enforces body size against both `Content-Length` and observed bytes, and never forwards a placeholder after acquisition failure. A 401 drains the response, conditionally invalidates the lease, and retries once; a second 401 is relayed and leaves a generic per-rule health problem. Command-credential traffic bypasses API debug capture and WebSocket upgrades fail closed.

The health payload exposes only rule ID, generic label, generic failure detail, and configured remediation under `authProblems.commandCredentials`; argv, stdout, and credentials are never included. `ProxyHealthCheck` parses that source-neutral shape, and Doctor renders the configured remediation without treating it as an executable action. Rule hosts are included in the proxy routing map, certificate keystore, and every complete DNS set. The proxy loads the file once at startup. `config.yaml` and CA reloads rebuild ordinary credentials and certificates around the already loaded rules rather than re-reading commands or policy; file metadata still contributes to drift detection. Applying an edit therefore requires both `isx proxy restart` and `isx proxy configure-dns`.

**Proxy caching**: The proxy caches immutable or version-pinned upstream payloads to avoid redundant downloads:
- **OCI blobs** — keyed by SHA256 content digest, verified on store
- **Maven artifacts** — keyed by group/artifact/version coordinate; mutable metadata and SNAPSHOT paths bypass the cache
- **Gradle distributions** — keyed by release filename and verified against the upstream SHA256 sidecar
- **npm tarballs** — keyed by package name and version, with ETag-based verification against the npm registry packument. When the packument ETag is unchanged, cached tarballs are served without re-verification. When the ETag changes, per-version shasum is checked — matching shasum updates the marker, mismatched shasum evicts and re-fetches
- **RubyGems payloads** — keyed by SHA256 under `~/.cache/incus-spawn/rubygems/objects/`. The proxy learns filename-to-digest mappings only from complete, bounded Compact Index `/info/<gem>` responses observed over TLS in the current process; each authority is scoped to its exact origin, superseded requests cannot overwrite newer observations, and observations expire after ten minutes. Partial, encoded, malformed, oversized, or stale metadata cannot authorize a cache read. The metadata itself is relayed with its ETag, Range, `Content-Range`, and `Repr-Digest` semantics intact and is never persisted as an authority. A complete public `GET /gems/*.gem` with no query, credentials, range, conditionals, representation exclusions, or cache directives may use the cache. A cold payload is downloaded to a bounded temporary file with serialized backpressured writes, coalesced by digest across concurrent requests, SHA256-verified before any client receives it, rechecked against the current metadata authorization, and atomically published under its digest. Persisted objects are re-hashed once per proxy process before their first use. Other requests bypass the cache, including payload redirects, which remain client-visible rather than expanding the proxy's trusted redirect surface

**Buffered I/O**: The proxy uses 64KB `BufferedInputStream`/`BufferedOutputStream` on both client and upstream connections for throughput. SSE and chunked streaming responses are flushed after each line/chunk to avoid buffering delays.

**OAuth token support:** Users with a Claude Pro/Max subscription (no API key) can authenticate via `claude setup-token`, which generates a long-lived (~1 year) OAuth token. The proxy injects `Authorization: Bearer <token>` into requests to `api.anthropic.com` and strips the container's placeholder `x-api-key` header. Containers are configured identically to direct API key mode (with `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-placeholder`). Unlike Vertex AI tokens, OAuth tokens cannot be refreshed automatically — when a 401 is received, the proxy logs an actionable error directing the user to re-run `isx init`.

**Tool-contributed proxy definitions:** Tools declare proxy entries via a `proxy:` block — either in YAML (`ProxyDef` with `configuration:` and `auth:`) or programmatically via `ToolSetup.proxy()` for CDI tools. A `ProxyDef` has shared `configuration:` (a map of `ConfigEntry` entries with `config-path`, `value`, `secret`, `type`, and `description`) and a list of `auth:` entries (`AuthDef`), each with a `domains:` list and an auth type (`basic`, `bearer`, `header`, or `anthropic`). Auth fields use `${configKey}` template references resolved against the shared configuration map — literals like `"x-access-token"` are passed through unchanged. Configuration resolution: `value` (hardcoded literal) > `config-path` (dot-path into `config.yaml`, e.g. `"github.token"`). User-defined tools use arbitrary config paths (e.g. `"myTool.apiKey"`) stored via `SpawnConfig.setConfigByPath()` and round-tripped through `@JsonAnySetter`/`@JsonAnyGetter`. Built-in proxy tools are CDI tools declaring `proxy()` directly: `ClaudeSetup` (1 auth entry: `api.anthropic.com`, `type: anthropic`), `GhSetup` (2 auth entries: `github.com` Basic with literal username, `*.github.com`+`*.githubusercontent.com` Bearer), `BobSetup` (1 auth entry for `bob.ibm.com` and regional domains, Header type), and `CodexSetup` (1 auth entry: `api.openai.com` Bearer, feature-gated behind `openai`). `type: anthropic` means the domain is handled by MitmProxy's hardcoded auth logic (three-way routing: Vertex, OAuth, API key) — the generic tool proxy injection path does not apply. Anthropic entries use relaxed configuration resolution (at least one non-blank credential, matching `ClaudeConfig.hasAuth()` semantics) and are excluded from MitmProxy's domain maps in `applyToolProxies()` but included in the fingerprint so credential changes trigger proxy restarts. `ToolProxyResolver` (in `common`) handles configuration resolution and fingerprinting; `findUnresolved()` returns configuration entries that could not be resolved (excluding `type: anthropic` entries), and `ProxyMain` warns at startup when unresolved entries are found. `MitmProxy` stores resolved generic entries in exact-match and wildcard-suffix maps for O(1)/O(n) domain lookup. Domain collisions between tools are warned at startup (exact-domain conflicts and wildcard-suffix overlaps); tool domains that shadow built-in intercepted domains (registry, Maven, Gradle, npm) are warned during validation since built-in routing takes precedence.

**Dynamic credential setup:** `isx init` builds its credential menu dynamically from tool setups via `ToolDefLoader.allToolSetups()`. Tools with proxy configuration are discovered, filtered by feature gates (`ToolSetup.feature()` + `SpawnConfig.isFeatureEnabled()`), and sorted (known tools first: claude, gh, bob, codex; then alphabetically). Each entry shows `ToolSetup.description()` and a `[configured]` tag. Known tools dispatch to specialized setup methods with validation (e.g., `setupClaudeAuth` with env-var detection and API verification); unknown tools use a generic prompt (`setupGenericToolCredentials`) that iterates `proxy.getConfiguration()` directly, respects `ConfigEntry.isSecret()` and `ConfigEntry.isConfirm()` (for y/n prompts like license acceptance), and saves via `SpawnConfig.setConfigByPath()` using the entry's `config-path`. User-defined tool YAMLs with proxy entries appear in the menu automatically.

**Configuration**: `~/.config/incus-spawn/config.yaml` (owner-only permissions, `chmod 600`). Startup-only command credential policy is isolated in `~/.config/incus-spawn/command-credentials.yaml` with independently enforced owner-only permissions and strict parsing. CA key and certificate are at `~/.config/incus-spawn/ca.key` and `~/.config/incus-spawn/ca.crt`. Vertex AI users must have `gcloud` installed on the host and `gcloud auth login` completed — the proxy and `isx init` both shell out to `gcloud auth print-access-token`, which reads the gcloud user credential, not application-default credentials.

### Host Resources

Template images can declare host files and directories to share with containers via the `host-resources` YAML key. Three modes control how the resource is made available:

**Readonly** (default): a read-only Incus disk device bind mount. The container can read the host file/directory but cannot modify it. Simple and safe for config files like `~/.gitconfig`.

**Overlay**: the host directory is attached as a read-only lower layer, with an ephemeral writable upper layer inside the container, combined via Linux overlayfs. The container sees a normal read-write directory, but writes go to the container-local upper layer — the host is fully protected. This is the right mode for caches (Maven, OCI) where tools expect to write but you don't need writes to persist back to the host.

**Copy**: the file or directory is copied into the container at build time and becomes part of the template. Supports local paths and URLs. No runtime dependency on the host.

#### Overlay internals

For a host-resource with `mode: overlay` targeting `/home/agentuser/.m2/repository`:

1. **Build time**: the host directory is attached as a read-only Incus disk device at `/var/lib/incus-spawn/overlays/home/agentuser/.m2/repository/lower`. The container creates `upper` and `work` siblings, then runs `mount -t overlay` to present the merged view at the target path. A systemd service (`incus-spawn-overlays.service`) is installed and enabled to re-apply the overlay mount on boot.

2. **After build**: the overlay is unmounted and the disk device is removed from the stopped template. The upper and work directories remain as container-local files. The full host-resource configuration is stored as JSON in `user.incus-spawn.host-resources` metadata.

3. **At branch time**: `BranchCommand` reads the stored metadata and re-attaches the disk device to the stopped instance before starting it. On boot, the systemd service re-mounts the overlay. The upper layer — now containing build artifacts — was copied via CoW when the instance was branched, so each instance has its own independent writable layer.

4. **On reboot**: the systemd service fires on every boot and re-mounts overlays. This works even if the container is started directly via `incus start` rather than through `isx`.

The overlay directory structure mirrors the container path directly under `/var/lib/incus-spawn/overlays/`, so the layout is self-documenting:

```
/var/lib/incus-spawn/overlays/home/agentuser/.m2/repository/
  ├── lower/    ← read-only disk device mount (host directory)
  ├── upper/    ← container-local writable layer (follows CoW branching)
  └── work/     ← overlayfs internal bookkeeping
```

Incus disk device names are derived from the container path for readability (e.g. `hr-home-agentuser--m2-repository`). They are removed from stopped templates to avoid host-path dependencies and re-attached at branch time.

#### VM behavior

VMs mount Incus disk devices asynchronously via virtiofs (managed by the `incus-agent`). For overlay mode, `applyOverlay` polls `mountpoint -q` for up to 15 seconds before running the overlay mount, since the lower directory may not be populated yet when the mount command runs. If the device doesn't appear in time, the overlay is skipped with a warning.

File-level host resources (individual files rather than directories) automatically fall back to `copy` mode on VMs, since Incus disk devices only support directory mounts for virtual machines. The fallback is logged: "VM: falling back to copy mode for file ...".

#### Missing sources

If a host path doesn't exist at build or branch time, the entry is skipped with a warning. The build/branch proceeds without it.

#### Inheritance

Host resources compose additively across the parent chain, with override-by-container-path. If a parent declares `~/.gitconfig` as `readonly` and a child declares `~/.gitconfig` as `copy`, the child's mode wins. This follows the same last-write-wins pattern as package deduplication.

### Metadata Tracking

Containers tagged via Incus `user.*` config keys:

```
user.incus-spawn.type=base
user.incus-spawn.profile=tpl-java
user.incus-spawn.parent=tpl-dev
user.incus-spawn.created=2026-04-07
user.incus-spawn.build-version=0.1.11        # isx version that built the template
user.incus-spawn.build-sha=c434ef9           # git commit SHA of isx at build time
user.incus-spawn.definition-sha=a1b2c3d4     # fingerprint of image def + tool defs
user.incus-spawn.ca-fingerprint=AB:CD:EF:... # CA certificate fingerprint
user.incus-spawn.build-source={...}          # (JSON, full image + tool defs for out-of-scope visibility)
user.incus-spawn.network-mode=PROXY_ONLY     # (proxy-only branches only)
user.incus-spawn.proxy-gateway=10.166.11.1   # (proxy-only branches only)
user.incus-spawn.static-ip=10.166.11.2       # (branches only, assigned at creation)
user.incus-spawn.host-resources=[...]        # (JSON, when host-resources declared)
user.incus-spawn.automation-key=allocation-17 # (automation-owned instances only)
user.incus-spawn.automation-template=tpl-bb   # (automation-owned instances only)
```

**Staleness detection**: The TUI uses `build-version` and `definition-sha` to display staleness indicators next to template names:
- `!` — template was built with a different isx version than the running CLI
- `△` — the image definition or its tool definitions have changed since the last build (fingerprint mismatch)
- `↑` — a parent template was rebuilt more recently than this template

**Build source storage**: `build-source` stores the full image definition hierarchy and tool definitions as JSON. This allows templates built from definitions that are no longer in scope (e.g. project-local definitions from a different working directory) to still be displayed and rebuilt in the TUI.

### Storage and COW

Copy-on-write storage is essential for efficient branching. `isx init` automatically creates a btrfs storage pool (`cow`) if no CoW-capable pool exists. On a CoW-capable pool (btrfs/zfs/lvm), Incus implements a same-pool `type: copy` as a native snapshot (e.g. `btrfs subvolume snapshot`), so copies are instant CoW clones with no data transfer — there is no need to use the Incus snapshot API explicitly. Full copies happen only in two cases: (1) there is no CoW pool at all (the `dir` driver uses rsync), or (2) the source instance's root disk is on a different pool than the copy target, forcing a cross-pool migration path.

A CoW pool is **required** for instance creation (`create`) and copying (`copy`/`planCopy`). `requireCowPool()` throws with a specific diagnostic (pool listing failed vs. no CoW pool found) instead of silently falling back to the default profile's pool, which on a pre-configured Ubuntu system is typically a `dir` pool. `findCowPool()` (nullable) remains for callers that handle absence gracefully (cleanup, diagnostics, TUI display, image import). `importImage()` uses `findCowPool()` and sends an `X-Incus-Pool` header when a CoW pool exists, so base images land on the CoW pool when possible — but does not throw when absent, since images are still usable on any pool.

`IncusClient.copy()` follows the source instance's pool: if the source's root disk is on a CoW pool, the copy targets that same pool (guaranteeing same-pool CoW); otherwise it targets the first CoW pool (cross-pool full copy). `planCopy()` also throws if no CoW pool exists. `isx branch` and `BuildCommand.buildFromParent()` compute a `CopyPlan` before copying and warn the user when the copy will be a full rsync (with a pointer to `isx doctor` for remediation). `isx doctor` surfaces three failure modes: no CoW pool at all (FAIL with a Linux remediation to create one), the default profile's root disk pointing to a non-CoW pool (WARN with auto-fix remediation), and instances whose root disk landed on a non-CoW pool (WARN naming the affected instances and suggesting rebuild or `incus move`).

A common trigger for stale profile state is setting up Incus before `isx init` (e.g. `incus admin init --minimal` on Ubuntu), which creates a `default` dir pool and sets the profile's root disk to it. `ensureDefaultProfile()` now upgrades the root disk to the CoW pool when it finds this mismatch during init.

Supported CoW drivers: **btrfs**, **zfs**, **lvm**. If btrfs pool creation fails during init (e.g. unsupported filesystem), the user is warned and can continue with the `dir` driver, but clones will be full copies.

**Disk-space visibility in the TUI**: All instances (and templates — templates are just stopped instances) share this one pool, so the pool's total is the real disk budget. On the macOS appliance the `cow` pool is a fixed-size VM disk, so its `space.total` *is* the VM's disk. The TUI surfaces this with a full-width **storage gauge** above the panels (green/amber/red by fill percentage) plus a per-row **DISK** column on both panels. The gauge reads whole-pool usage (`getPoolUsageBytes`); the per-row figures come from `state.disk.<dev>.usage` in the recursion=2 listing the TUI already fetches, so no extra API cost. Two deliberate honesty choices follow from the CoW model: (1) per-row usage is shown as **absolute used bytes**, never as a percentage of the instance's `root.size` — that limit is a thin-provisioned ceiling (defaults to 100 GB), not an allocation, so a percentage would be meaningless; (2) per-row figures are marked approximate (`~`).

The per-row number is hard because the only figure Incus exposes (`state.disk.<dev>.usage`) is btrfs *exclusive* bytes — blocks unique to that one subvolume — and exclusive **collapses to ~0 for any subvolume that has a CoW descendant**. So a template's real weight is invisible: the moment a child template or a branch exists, the parent's own layer stops being exclusive to it. The base image and every shared block belong to no row and appear only in the pool total. The figure that *does* answer "how big is this template" is btrfs **referenced** (rfer) — a subvolume's full logical size including blocks it shares with ancestors — but Incus exposes no API for it (its btrfs driver reads the qgroup and returns only the exclusive column).

So `isx` reads rfer itself, and caches it. Because a built template is immutable and its rfer is stable (referenced bytes don't change when a parent is later deleted — the child still references those extents), `BuildCommand` measures rfer **once at build time** and stamps it as `user.incus-spawn.disk-referenced` metadata (excluded from the content fingerprint, so it never triggers a rebuild). The TUI then reads that stamp for free on every reload and shows each template as a **delta from its parent**: the root template's delta is its own rfer — i.e. the base-image weight — and each derived template shows only what its layer added (packages, a tools install), which is exactly the intuitive "cost of this template". Instances keep their exclusive usage: a branch with no descendants has `exclusive ≈ rfer − rfer(parent)`, so exclusive already *is* its delta, and it comes free from the API. This replaces the older `foldBaseWeightIntoRootTemplate`, which — lacking rfer — could only dump the *entire* pool remainder onto the root template, so on a real inheritance chain the base template ballooned to include every layer's shared blocks while the intermediate templates read ~0. The fold survives only as a fallback: when a template predates the stamp (cache-only, no backfill — rebuild to populate it) or the pool isn't btrfs, the display falls back to exclusive-plus-fold.

Instances (unlike templates) are mutable, so they are never stamped — each instance row always shows its **live exclusive** usage from the Incus API, recomputed every reload. The reading is "space reclaimed by deleting just this row": an instance branched from another instance shares its inherited blocks with the source, so those blocks are exclusive to neither and float in the pool total (visible in the gauge, attributed to no row) exactly like template-shared blocks. This makes instance→instance branching safe by construction: because nothing is cached, deleting the branched-from instance needs no invalidation — on the next reload the surviving branch's exclusive usage simply grows to absorb the blocks that were shared, since they are now unique to it. The delete-confirmation note closes the loop in the other direction: before the shared-with-parent caveat it checks whether anything was branched or derived from the target (`hasDescendant`, using the parent each row already records for free) and, if so, warns that deleting it reclaims little while its descendants remain — the instance analog of the base-template note.

Deleting a template is safe: rfer is a property of the *extents a subvolume references*, so a child's stamped rfer stays accurate after its parent is deleted (the child still references — and keeps alive — those blocks). Only the delta arithmetic has to cope with a missing parent, and it does: the row's parent is resolved by climbing the *definitional* chain (the on-disk YAML, which outlives the deleted instance) to the nearest ancestor that still exists and is stamped (`nearestStampedAncestorRfer`). So deleting an intermediate template just makes the next survivor down the chain subtract the next survivor up — no phantom subtraction, no crash — and if the entire chain above a row is gone, its parent resolves to `null` and it shows full rfer, correctly re-absorbing the base weight that no other row now claims. The rows keep reconciling with the gauge; the only residual imprecision is that blocks shared *between siblings* of a deleted fork point get counted in each sibling — bounded, and already flagged by the `~` marker. The delete-confirmation dialog restates the caveat at the moment it matters — for a clone, "blocks shared with `<parent>` stay until the parent is removed"; for the base template, that most of its size is the shared base image and won't be reclaimed while derivatives exist.

Reading rfer needs root (the qgroup ioctls need `CAP_SYS_ADMIN` and the pool directory is `0700 root`), and `isx` normally runs as an unprivileged user. Rather than prompt for sudo on every TUI refresh, the privileged read is split by platform (`BtrfsUsage`): on **Linux** the pool is on the host, so `isx init` installs a tightly-scoped NOPASSWD sudoers rule (`/etc/sudoers.d/incus-spawn-btrfs`, validated with `visudo -cf`) permitting *only* read-only `btrfs qgroup show -re --raw [--sync]`/`subvolume list` against the pool mount (both the plain and `--sync` command forms are listed, since sudo matches argv exactly); on **macOS** the pool lives inside the appliance VM, where the in-VM control agent already runs as root, so it gains a `btrfs-usage` verb (still an allowlisted one-verb dispatcher, not a general guest-exec channel). Both paths feed one unit-tested parser (`BtrfsUsage.parse`, joining qgroup rfer to subvolume paths). Since rfer is read only at build time (plus the fallback), the privileged surface is exercised rarely, not on every refresh.

Two btrfs quirks make the stamp-time read fragile, both handled in `BuildCommand.probeReferencedSize` (which measures) / `stampReferencedSize` (which records) and `BtrfsUsage`: (1) qgroup accounting only reflects *committed* transactions, so a read right after a build can miss its final writes; (2) deleting a subvolume can mark the pool's qgroup accounting inconsistent, and a rebuild does exactly that (`deleteIfExists` of the previous template) immediately before stamping. For (2), `probeReferencedSize` measures rfer against the freshly-built *temp* subvolume **before** the delete/rename, not after — rfer is per-subvolume, so the temp name reports the same value the canonical name will. For (1), the read comes in two flavours (`BtrfsUsage.probe(pool, sync)`): the stamp-time read passes `--sync` to force a commit first, while the plain read (the default, and the intended path for periodic sampling) skips it, because forcing a whole-filesystem commit on every sampling tick would be wasteful. The `--sync` flavour must stay in step across three layers — the Java command, the `isx-agent`'s `btrfs-usage <pool> [sync]` verb (an allowlisted second token), and the sudoers rule (which lists both command forms) — or the privileged read is denied.

Getting a stamp wrong no longer collapses the whole display. `canUseReferencedModel` gates the delta model on every built **root** template being stamped (the root carries the base-image weight, so without its rfer the shared-base fold is the better model); a built *derived* template missing its stamp is tolerated — `applyReferencedTemplateDeltas` leaves that one row on its exclusive usage instead of dropping every template to ~0. So a transient read failure at build time degrades a single row, not the entire panel.

A missing stamp also self-heals on reload without a rebuild: `fillMissingReferencedSizes` backfills it with a single live probe — using the light (non-sync) flavour, and *only* when there's an actual gap (an unstamped built template). This keeps the privileged read out of the healthy per-refresh path (a fully-stamped install never probes on reload) while recovering pre-feature templates and the rare failed stamp; the backfill is in-memory (a rebuild re-stamps permanently) and never overwrites an existing stamp, which is authoritative and free.

**The accounting itself can be silently wrong, so it is checked and repaired.** Ordering the read before the delete addresses a *transient* effect; the real failure is persistent and filesystem-wide. The kernel flags a pool's qgroup accounting `inconsistent` — and from then on freezes every counter at its last value — when quotas are enabled on a pool that already holds data, or when dropping a subvolume would require walking a shared subtree deeper than `drop_subtree_threshold`. Both are routine for isx: Incus enables quotas lazily, when the first instance size limit is applied (by which time the image and every template already exist), and the appliance kernel runs with the threshold at 3, so template rebuilds keep re-tripping it. Nothing clears the flag except a completed `btrfs quota rescan`. The frozen values are not zeros but plausible numbers (each snapshot inherits its source's rfer, so every subvolume reports the base image's ~113 MiB with 16 KiB exclusive), which is why this went unnoticed: they pass the `<= 0` stamp guard, get recorded, and the delta model subtracts identical stamps to exactly `~0B` per layer; the exclusive fallback and Incus's own `state.disk` usage read the same frozen qgroups, so there is no untainted fallback — only the statfs-based gauge stays right. The fix is a trust gate plus an automatic repair, both in `BtrfsUsage`. The kernel exposes the flags world-readable in sysfs (`/sys/fs/btrfs/<fsid>/qgroups/{enabled,inconsistent,mode,drop_subtree_threshold}`), so *detection* needs no privilege at all: `BtrfsSysfs` resolves the pool's fsid on Linux (via the containing btrfs mount's *source device* in `/proc/self/mountinfo` — btrfs `st_dev` numbers are per-subvolume, so neither `stat` nor mountinfo's `major:minor` identify the block device), and the agent's `btrfs-status` verb does the same lookup inside the VM; one `parseStatus` serves both. `repairIfInconsistent` reads the status and, if the accounting is inconsistent, starts the rescan asynchronously — the kernel rebuilds the counters in the background and clears the flag when done, seconds on a developer-sized pool — throttled to one trigger per minute and five per process (on Linux via a `btrfs quota rescan <pool>` entry added to the sudoers rule at `INIT_VERSION` 6; on macOS via the agent's `btrfs-rescan` verb). Consumers act on `untrusted()` only — a status that *can't be read* (older agent, pre-6.1 kernel, quotas off) keeps the pre-check behaviour rather than blanking the display. `IncusClient.delete()` — the single method every subvolume delete funnels through, `deleteIfExists` included — calls it right after the delete succeeds (best-effort, never failing a delete that already worked): a delete is exactly the operation that can cause the inconsistency, so this catches it immediately instead of waiting for the next reload or build. Deletes arrive in bursts (`isx clean` sweeping failed builds, destroying a set of branches), so that path uses `repairIfInconsistentThrottled`, which collapses a burst to one check (5s minimum spacing) and defers the caller's pool lookup behind the same gate — otherwise N deletes would mean N status reads, each an agent round trip on macOS. Nothing is missed by collapsing: only the deletes in the burst could have set the flag, the first check already caught that and started the rescan, and the TUI cadence and next build re-check regardless. The rescan-trigger budget (`MAX_RESCAN_TRIGGERS`) counts *consecutive* attempts and resets the moment accounting reads consistent, so it bounds a stuck repair rather than capping how many times a long-lived session may legitimately self-heal. The TUI also calls it every reload (cadence-limited: 30s normally, 2s while a repair is pending, so an agent round trip on macOS isn't on the hot path): while untrusted it keeps showing existing stamps (a stamp taken from consistent accounting stays valid, templates being immutable), reads nothing live (no backfill, no shared-base fold) and shows a one-shot "repairing" hint; the reload that first sees the flag clear re-validates the stamps with one live probe and re-stamps whatever differs — the one path that overwrites a stamp, which also fires once per session on the poisoned-stamp signature (a derived template stamped with exactly its parent's value) so pools broken before the check existed heal without a rebuild. `BuildCommand.probeReferencedSize` runs the same detect-and-repair before stamping, with a bounded wait (`awaitConsistent`, 20s) so the usual case still gets an immediate, correct stamp. `isx doctor` reports the state and offers the rescan for when the automatic one couldn't run. The `C` key reclaims space via `isx clean pool` (failed builds, unused images, build caches). Labelled "Storage" rather than "pool" to avoid leaking the Incus term, and the gauge/column degrade gracefully to hidden/`-` on `dir` pools that report no per-volume usage.

Reclaiming isn't always enough: on the macOS appliance the pool is capped by the VM's data disk, so once real usage approaches the ceiling the fix is to *grow the disk*, not delete work. `isx vm resize <size>` does this (macOS only — on native Linux the pool grows with the host filesystem, so the command isn't registered there at all). The data disk is a sparse raw image on the host; resizing extends the file (`RandomAccessFile.setLength`, grow-only) while the VM is stopped, then the guest expands the btrfs filesystem to fill the larger device on the next boot — a one-line `btrfs filesystem resize max /var/lib/incus` in the appliance init that mirrors the root disk's existing auto-resize. The data disk is deliberately separate from the root disk and survives root-disk upgrades, so growth persists across appliance version bumps. The resize verifies the pool total actually grew after reboot and warns if the running appliance predates the auto-resize step (the image grew but the filesystem didn't). The critical-fill TUI warning names both remedies — `C` to reclaim, `isx vm resize` to expand.

### Repo Cloning and Reference Optimization

Repos declared in an image definition are cloned into the container during build as `agentuser`. Clones use `--single-branch` to fetch only the target branch (or the default branch when none is specified), avoiding the download of hundreds of release/PR branches and thousands of tags that are present on large upstream repos but rarely needed in a dev container. After cloning, `git remote set-branches origin '*'` immediately widens the fetch refspec — this is a pure metadata write with no network traffic — so the clone is indistinguishable from a regular one. Other branches populate lazily on first `git fetch` or `git checkout`.

**Parallel cloning**: when a template declares multiple repos they are cloned concurrently, bounded to the host's high-performance ("P") core count (`CpuInfo.highPerfCores()` — `sysctl hw.perflevel0.logicalcpu` on macOS, `cpu_capacity` on Linux, falling back to all logical processors). `CpuInfo` is the shared home for CPU-topology detection: it also backs the appliance VM's vCPU default (`VmManager.detectCpus()` → `performanceCores()`) and the native-image-safe host processor count (`ResourceLimits.hostProcessorCount()` → `logicalCores()`, which reads `/proc/cpuinfo`/`sysctl` rather than `Runtime.availableProcessors()` since the CLI native image pins the latter via `-R:ActiveProcessorCount`). Cloning runs entirely with captured (non-streamed) exec so the many parallel clones don't garble the terminal; progress is rendered by the shared `TerminalProgress` helper as one animated braille-spinner line per repo (green ✓ / red ✗ on completion), falling back to plain per-repo log lines on a non-ANSI terminal. Any clone failure is surfaced after the batch and aborts the build. Because Incus config mutations must not run concurrently, the mount/unmount of the host-reference disk devices is done in serial phases *around* the parallel section: mount all references → clone-and-prime all in parallel → remove all references. Each repo's declared `prime` command (also captured, no PTY) runs in the same worker the instant that repo's clone completes — so priming pipelines with the clones still in flight rather than waiting for the whole clone batch. A single progress line per repo advances Cloning → Priming → ✓/✗. Failures are aggregated and abort the build; as a best-effort fail-fast, once any repo fails a clone that completes afterward skips launching its (potentially expensive) prime — primes already in flight run to completion.

**Local-clone optimization**: When `host-paths` or `repo-paths` is configured in `~/.config/incus-spawn/config.yaml`, the build checks whether a matching host-side checkout exists before cloning. The lookup first checks direct children of each configured base directory, then recursively scans subdirectories up to 4 levels deep (skipping known non-project directories like `.git`, `node_modules`, `target`, `build`, `vendor`, etc.) to handle repos organized in nested folder structures (e.g. `~/Code/java/repo-a`). When a repo subdirectory exists in more than one location, the build fails with an error instructing the user to add an explicit `repo-paths` entry to disambiguate. Matching uses URL normalization (strips scheme, `user@`, SSH colon separator, trailing `.git`, `www.`, then lowercases) and checks **all** git remotes, not just `origin` — this handles the common case where the user's fork is `origin` and the canonical upstream is `upstream`. If a match is found, the host directory is temporarily mounted into the container as a read-only Incus disk device (`readonly=true shift=true`) at a fixed path under `/var/lib/incus-spawn/repo-ref/` and cloned locally via `git clone --no-hardlinks`. This copies pack files directly — no network transfer and, critically, no `git repack` or dissociation step. The old approach used `git clone --reference` and then ran `git repack -a -d` to make the clone self-contained before unmounting the reference; for large repos this repack was the dominant cost (re-reading, re-deltifying, and rewriting every object). The local-clone approach avoids it entirely: pack files are copied as-is, then the remote URL is fixed to the real origin and a `git fetch` picks up any commits added since the last host refresh (usually nothing — `HostRepoRefresh` just ran — so only ref advertisements travel the network). If a specific branch was requested, it is checked out after the fetch supplies the ref. The clone includes objects reachable from all branches in the reference (pack files can't be efficiently subsetted), but only the needed refs are set up; extra objects are harmless dead weight cleaned by a future `git gc`. Only committed history is copied — the host repo's working tree, index, staged changes, and untracked files are never touched. If the reference mount, clone, or fetch fails for any reason the build cleans up the partial checkout and falls back transparently to a plain remote clone.

**TUI visibility**: The F3 template detail view shows the host repo link status for each declared repo — the resolved host path when matched, or "No matching host checkout found" when not. This lets users verify their `host-paths`/`repo-paths` configuration without running a build.

### Git Remote Helper

Containers cloned via `isx branch` are isolated development environments, but developers need a way to get their changes back to the host. Rather than inventing a custom sync mechanism, incus-spawn integrates with git's native remote helper protocol so standard `git fetch`/`git push`/`git pull` work between host repos and container repos.

**Architecture: bash shim + Java command**

The git remote helper is split into two processes:

1. **`git-remote-isx`** (bash script): installed alongside `isx` in `$PATH`. Git discovers it automatically when a remote URL uses the `isx://` scheme. The script handles the text-based git remote helper protocol (advertising the `connect` capability), then `exec`s `isx git-remote-helper` to handle the actual transport.

2. **`isx git-remote-helper`** (Java/picocli command): validates the instance is running, validates the requested service against an allowlist, and uses `IncusClient.execBidirectional` to run `<service> '<path>'` inside the container with stdin/stdout forwarded over WebSocket. The git pack protocol flows directly between the host git process and the container git process.

The bash `exec` replaces the shell process with the Java process before any data flows through stdin. This is critical: Java's `BufferedInputStream` would consume bytes from the stdin pipe that are meant for the git pack protocol, corrupting the stream. By having bash handle only the text protocol exchange (a few short lines) and then `exec`-replacing itself, the Java process inherits the raw file descriptors with no buffered-ahead data.

Stderr is captured in a virtual thread so the command can detect "not a git repository" errors and print hints listing known repos from the image definition chain.

**URL scheme**

`isx://<instance-name>/<path-to-repo>` — for example, `isx://fix-auth/home/agentuser/quarkus` or `isx://fix-auth/~/quarkus` (tilde expands to `/home/agentuser`).

**Auto-remote management**

When the user configures `host-paths` (and optionally `repo-paths`) in `config.yaml`, incus-spawn automatically adds and removes git remotes in host repositories:

- **On `isx branch`**: for each repo declared in the image definition chain, resolve the corresponding host repo via `repo-paths` (exact match) or `host-paths` (base directories scanned recursively up to 4 levels deep). Direct-child matches take priority; recursive scanning only fires when no direct match exists. When the same repo name appears in more than one location, the operation fails with an error instructing the user to add an explicit `repo-paths` entry. Verify that any of the host repo's remotes (not just `origin`) match the container repo's URL (protocol-lenient comparison). If a match is found, add a remote named after the instance.
- **On `isx destroy`**: scan candidate host repos for any remote with a URL matching `isx://<instance-name>/` and remove it.

The removal is stateless — rather than tracking which remotes were added, we scan for `isx://` URLs matching the instance name. This avoids a class of bugs where state gets out of sync (e.g., the user manually removes a remote, or the add failed silently).

**Protocol-lenient URL matching**

Host repos may use SSH URLs (`git@github.com:org/repo.git`) while container repos use HTTPS (`https://github.com/org/repo.git`). The URL matcher normalizes both formats by stripping the scheme, `user@` prefix, SSH `:` separator, trailing `.git`, `www.` prefix, and lowercasing. The result is a canonical form like `github.com/org/repo` that matches regardless of protocol.

### Native image CPU baseline

Both binaries are built with `-march=haswell` on x86_64, set by arch-gated Maven profiles in
`proxy/pom.xml` and `cli/pom.xml` so aarch64 builds (Linux arm64, Apple Silicon) pass no
`-march` at all — an x86 value there is a hard build failure.

GraalVM's default is `-march=x86-64-v3`, and the numbered psABI levels **do not include AES
or CLMUL**. Without those the image cannot emit AES-NI/GHASH intrinsics, so TLS bulk
encryption runs as software AES. Every byte through this proxy is AES-GCM encrypted on both
legs — once to the client on a cache hit, twice on a miss (decrypt from upstream, re-encrypt
to the client) — so that fallback dominates. Serving a cached 642 KB Maven artifact, measured
with `bench/run.sh --load=maven`, same commit and host, Oracle GraalVM 25.3:

| `-march` | Throughput | Note |
|---|---|---|
| `x86-64-v3` (GraalVM default) | 73 MB/s | no AES/CLMUL |
| `x86-64-v4` | 73 MB/s | AVX-512 but still no AES — a trap |
| **`haswell`** | **960 MB/s** | v3 + AES + CLMUL; what we ship |
| `skylake` | 950 MB/s | + ADX; indistinguishable from haswell |
| `native` | 1067 MB/s | not portable |

That is a **~13x** difference, and `haswell` costs no hardware support whatsoever: AES-NI
shipped in 2010, three years *before* the AVX2/BMI2 that `x86-64-v3` already demands, so
every CPU able to run a v3 build already has it. Binary size is unchanged.

`skylake` (haswell + ADX) was measured over three interleaved rounds and came out
indistinguishable — 1530 vs 1514 req/s, with the ordering reversing between rounds. ADX buys
nothing on this path, so there is no reason to accept its narrowing (it would drop Intel
Haswell 2013-14 and AMD Excavator, which run v3 code).

Two things that look like they should help and do not, both measured:

- **`-H:RuntimeCheckedCPUFeatures` does not cover the crypto intrinsics.** Adding
  `AES,CLMUL` to a v3 build left throughput unchanged, and adding the AVX-512 set to a
  build with AES recovered only ~1 of the ~11 points `native` holds. The AES-GCM intrinsic
  is selected at build time from `-march`; runtime dispatch applies to a narrower set of
  operations, and its AMD64 default is already `AVX,AVX2`. Note the option *replaces* that
  default rather than extending it, so anything added must re-state `AVX,AVX2`.
- **Raising to `x86-64-v4`** buys nothing and costs all non-AVX-512 hardware.

### Why the CLI takes the same flag

The CLI downloads tool tarballs and VM images over HTTPS (`DownloadCache`, `SkillsCache`,
`VmManager`), all through the JDK's `HttpClient`, so it pays the same software-AES cost.
Measured directly on AES-256-GCM in a native image from this toolchain: **79 MB/s at
`x86-64-v3` vs ~3100 MB/s at `haswell`** — a 39x difference. At 79 MB/s a 384 MB tool tarball
costs ~4.9s of CPU on crypto alone, so any link faster than ~630 Mbit/s makes the CLI
crypto-bound rather than network-bound.

The CLI's build is tuned for size and startup (`-Os`, serial GC), which is why `-O3` was
rejected there at +131% size. `-march=haswell` costs neither: the binary is **byte-identical**
(32,115,704 B either way) and startup is ~11% *faster* (median 3489 vs 3924 us over three
interleaved rounds of 40 runs). The startup gain is unexplained; `haswell` adds CLMUL over
`x86-64-v3` alongside AES, which backs the CRC32 intrinsic, but that is a hypothesis.

Reproduce with `bench/run.sh --load=maven`. Use that harness rather than a shell loop of
`curl`: process-spawn overhead caps such a loop around 550 req/s, which silently pins every
build faster than v3 to the same wrong number and hides the differences between them.

### Build-time initialization must not capture host paths

Quarkus initializes application classes at image-build time unless they are listed in
`--initialize-at-run-time`, so anything reachable from a static initializer is constructed by the
*builder* and snapshotted into the image heap — fields and all. On Linux the builder is **root
inside the GraalVM builder container** (`install.sh` drives native-image through docker/podman,
where `$HOME=/root`), so a field holding an `Environment` path freezes the builder's home rather
than the user's.

Host-derived state that must be resolved eagerly therefore lives in exactly two classes, both on
the flag: **`RuntimeConstants`** in `common` (the immutable `ISX_POOL` selection, download and skills
cache directories, plus the Java tool setups holding them) and **`RuntimeServices`** in the CLI
(Incus client, background tasks, pool-aware lock manager, tool-def loader). Both say so in their
javadoc; `Environment` itself is on the list too and stays
method-based, which is also what lets tests retarget `user.home`. Everywhere else, call the
`Environment` method rather than storing its result.

Deferring the class that *resolves* the path is not sufficient on its own — the **holder** must be
deferred too, which is why `CDI_TOOLS` lives in `RuntimeConstants`. GraalVM does not reject a
build-time initializer that touches a run-time-initialized class; it initializes it early and folds
the value, with no error (what `Environment`'s header comment warns about, confirmed by building it
both ways). That is how this shipped: `DownloadCache` resolves `RuntimeConstants.DOWNLOAD_CACHE_DIR`
in its constructor and `ClaudeSetup`/`BobSetup` each hold one; those instances used to be created in
`RuntimeServices`, and commit 08a8ea0 (2026-08-26) moved the list into `ToolDefLoader`, which is not
on the flag — so the binary carried `/root/.cache/incus-spawn/downloads` as a constant and
`isx build` failed on any template with a `claude` or `bob` tool. The diagnosis was a bare path:
`Failed to install Claude Code: /root/.cache/incus-spawn`, an `AccessDeniedException` message from
`Files.createDirectories` walking into a directory only root can read. Everything else kept working,
because every other `Environment` read happens at runtime — so it read as a container problem, not a
build-host leak. `DownloadCache` now names the directory it failed to create.

Two mechanisms keep it from recurring. `BakedHostPathFeature` registers an object replacer — the
analysis calls it for every object scanned into the image heap — and aborts the build if a constant
is, or lives under, one of the *builder's* own directories (`user.home`, `user.dir`). Its precision
comes from an explicit, reviewable allowed list rather than from guessing which paths matter: an
earlier version only flagged builder paths containing `incus-spawn`, which would have tolerated a
baked `~/.m2/repository`, `~/.config/incus/`, `~/.local/bin/isx` or bare `$HOME`. It checks `Path`
objects as well as their string form, because `sun.nio.fs.UnixPath` stores bytes and computes its
`String` lazily — a folded path can reach the heap with no matching `String` object at all (this
regression produced both, and the guard reports both). Second, `NativeImageInitializationTest` parses
all three declarations of the build arguments — each module's `resources-filtered/application.properties`
plus the duplicate list in `cli/pom.xml`'s `macos-native` profile — and fails in `mvn test` if one
stops deferring a class or stops registering a guard; a Linux build would otherwise never notice the
macOS copy drifting.

The sibling guard `SyscallReachabilityFeature` targets something else — keeping lazy system-property
resolvers off the startup path of short-lived commands — and currently cannot fail, because it
resolves its targets on an abstract GraalVM class whose concrete overrides are what the analysis
reaches. It now prints `INCONCLUSIVE` per target instead of `ok`, so the report stops reading as
evidence; `.claude/rules/native-image.md` records what fixing it involves.

## Testing

**Unit tests** (`mvn test`, no Incus needed):
- `ToolDefTest` — YAML tool parsing, fingerprinting, composite fingerprints with transitive dependencies
- `ToolDefLoaderTest` — resolution order (builtins, user overrides, unknown tools)
- `YamlToolSetupTest` — execution order with mocked Container
- `ImageDefTest` — image definition loading, parent chain, strict security parsing/inheritance, template discovery, descriptions, fingerprinting
- `BuildCommandTest` — exact hardened/opted-in Incus calls, guest scrub-script content, `.claude.json` trust configuration, skill deduplication across inheritance chains, shell quoting, GitHub URL parsing
- `GitRemoteUtilsTest` — URL normalization (SSH/HTTPS/case), protocol-lenient matching, reference device naming (hash-based, truncation, collision resistance), host repo matching across multiple remotes
- `IncusApiTest` — REST API request/response parsing, exec body format, default exec environment, LOGIN_PATH_PREFIX

**Live tests** (`sg incus-admin -c "mvn test"`, requires Incus daemon + cached test image):
- `IncusApiLiveTest` — REST protocol against real Incus: all endpoints, exec capture/stream, device ops, copy, launch, logs
- `IncusClientSmokeTest` — high-level API: pollUntilReady, shellExec, execBidirectional, execPty, runAsUser, copy, filePush, filePushRecursive (directory placement + permission preservation), login PATH
- `BuildPipelineSmokeTest` — full buildFromScratch + buildFromParent operation sequence

**Integration tests** (`mvn verify -DskipITs=false`, requires Incus):
- `TemplateBuildIT` — builds actual images, verifies metadata and agentuser

**Manual security smoke checklist** (requires live Incus and is deliberately not covered by unit tests):
1. Build and inspect `tpl-minimal`; verify `agentuser` has no sudo/group/subid privileges, the development sysctl file is absent, the listed Incus security keys are absent, and no `tun` device exists.
2. Build and inspect `tpl-dev`; verify passwordless sudo and rootless Podman work and that every declared Incus setting/device is present.
3. Build a hardened child directly from `tpl-dev`; verify the same hardened state as `tpl-minimal`. This specifically exercises the stopped-container ownership/idmap transition from a permissive parent.
4. Build hardened and opted-in templates from both current pre-baked container and VM images. Verify UID 1000 ownership remains correct after idmap changes; VMs must have only the intended in-guest state and no container-specific Incus settings.

**Manual automation mount checklist** (do not fold into the unit suite; run against disposable instances and paths):
1. On Linux, mount and unmount read-only and read-write directories while an owned container is stopped and running. Inspect the instance's own devices after each operation and verify the exact source, target, type, and presence/absence of `readonly=true`; repeat each command to verify idempotency.
2. Before each unmount, alter source, target, access, and one extra device field in turn. Verify every mismatch fails without removing or replacing the device. Repeat with another key, transient/error states, unsafe names, relative/`..`/root paths, NUL/newline input, and a malformed own device.
3. On a named macOS pool, attach workspace leaves read-write and read-only. Verify the Incus source is the exact `/host/workspace/...` leaf, host writes work only for the read-write request, and an explicit read-only request remains read-only inside the instance.
4. Attempt read-write mounts from runtime and each reference export, undeclared paths, symlink escapes, and a workspace leaf symlink resolving to the workspace root. Verify rejection before Incus mutation. Change the running export fingerprint and verify translation also fails closed.
5. Mount runtime/reference leaves read-only and confirm both the inner Incus flag and outer VZ share prevent writes. Repeat through the macOS vsock path with both stopped and running containers, then verify lifecycle JSON remains one line and contains neither source nor target.

Do not treat unit tests as coverage for these ownership/idmap transitions: they can assert the exact REST calls and scripts, but only a live Incus storage backend performs the on-disk remapping.

## Technical Tradeoffs

### System containers vs application containers
System containers run a full init system and present as a complete machine. This means higher base image size (~200MB vs ~5MB Alpine) and longer first-build time (system upgrade, user creation, tool installation). However, clones are instant and near-zero cost with CoW storage, which is the common operation — you build once, branch many times.

### Explicit capability retention (`lxc.cap.drop =`)
Standard Incus containers drop Linux capabilities for defense in depth, and hardened isx templates retain that default. Development templates can opt into `permissive-capabilities` when they require `ping`, `strace`, `perf`, raw sockets, or `dmesg`. The option deliberately broadens the impact of a container escape; use it only for workloads that need bare-metal-like debugging, and prefer a VM when stronger isolation matters.

### YAML tools vs a full plugin system (Packer, Ansible, etc.)
We evaluated Packer (null builder + shell provisioner) and Ansible but rejected both. Packer's null builder is just indirection over what Java already does, and Ansible adds a Python dependency and playbook complexity for what amounts to "install some packages and run some scripts." YAML tool definitions give 90% of the flexibility with zero dependencies. Java `ToolSetup` implementations remain available as an escape hatch for tools that need programmatic logic (reading host config, conditional branching).

### Hardcoded built-in tool list vs classpath scanning
Built-in YAML tools are loaded from a hardcoded list of filenames rather than scanning the classpath. This is a deliberate choice: Quarkus native image compilation makes classpath directory listing unreliable, and the list only changes when a developer adds a built-in tool (at which point they also update the loader). User-defined tools in `.incus-spawn/tools/` are discovered via filesystem scanning.

### DNS: static resolv.conf + bridge dnsmasq
systemd-resolved (127.0.0.53) doesn't work reliably inside Incus containers because it expects to manage the network configuration. We disable it, point `/etc/resolv.conf` directly at the Incus bridge gateway (which runs dnsmasq), and make the file immutable with `chattr +i`. This is less flexible than systemd-resolved (no per-link DNS, no DNSSEC validation) but works reliably across container restarts and network changes. Domain interception for the MITM proxy is configured at the bridge level via `raw.dnsmasq` (dnsmasq `address=` directives), not via per-container `/etc/hosts`. This avoids a class of bugs where Incus overwrites `/etc/hosts` on container start.

### Credential isolation via MITM TLS proxy
A TLS-terminating MITM proxy intercepts HTTPS connections to specific domains (Anthropic API, GitHub, IBM Bob), injects authentication headers server-side, and forwards to the real upstream. Containers resolve these domains to the gateway IP via bridge-level dnsmasq overrides configured during normal proxy setup or explicitly with `isx proxy configure-dns`, and trust the proxy's certificates via a custom CA installed in the template image. This approach was chosen over simpler alternatives (reverse proxy with `ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL`, credential helpers, shell wrappers) because those approaches still expose credentials to code running inside the container — either as environment variables, in process memory via `curl` calls, or through accessible endpoints. The MITM proxy provides complete isolation: there is no API, endpoint, environment variable, or file that container code can access to obtain credentials.

### Vertex AI: container in Vertex mode vs standard mode
We initially ran containers in standard (non-Vertex) mode with proxy-side API translation — the container sent `/v1/messages` and the proxy rewrote to Vertex `rawPredict`. This had a critical flaw: Claude Code's model list is provider-dependent. In standard "firstParty" mode the model picker is a hardcoded subset that omits newer models (e.g. Opus 4.6 was missing). In Vertex mode the full catalogue is shown.

The solution: containers now run in Vertex mode with `CLAUDE_CODE_USE_VERTEX=1`, `CLAUDE_CODE_SKIP_VERTEX_AUTH=1` (skips GCP auth — the SDK uses stub credentials that produce empty auth headers), and `ANTHROPIC_VERTEX_BASE_URL=https://api.anthropic.com/v1` (redirects the Vertex SDK to the proxy). The Vertex SDK formats requests in Vertex URL format (`/v1/projects/.../models/...:streamRawPredict`), sends them to the proxy, and the proxy injects real GCP credentials before forwarding to the actual Vertex endpoint. The proxy also retains the standard-to-Vertex translation path for `/v1/messages` requests — this is the primary path for tools like Pi that use the standard Anthropic API format, and also serves manual `curl` calls inside the container.

**Fragility and mitigation:** The standard-to-Vertex translation path uses an allowlist (`VERTEX_ALLOWED_FIELDS` in `MitmProxy.java`) that may drift as Anthropic adds new standard fields. However, the primary traffic flow (Vertex passthrough) doesn't use the allowlist — the Vertex SDK already formats the body correctly. The allowlist only affects the fallback translation path. The `anthropic_version: "vertex-2023-10-16"` value is hardcoded in the translation path — this matches the Anthropic Vertex SDK and has been stable since Vertex support launched. The Vertex passthrough path doesn't set this value; the SDK does it itself.

### Git remote helper: bash + Java split
The git remote helper is split into a bash shim and a Java command rather than implementing the full protocol in Java. The reason is stdin buffering: Java's `BufferedInputStream` (used by `System.in` and `ProcessBuilder`) reads ahead into an internal buffer. In the git remote helper protocol, the initial text exchange ("capabilities", "connect git-upload-pack") is followed by a binary pack protocol stream on the same stdin pipe. If Java reads even one byte too many during the text phase, the binary stream is corrupted. The bash shim handles only the text protocol (a few short lines via `read`), then `exec`-replaces itself with the Java process. The Java process inherits raw file descriptors with no buffered-ahead data and can safely use `execBidirectional` (WebSocket-based stdin/stdout forwarding) to pipe the git pack protocol to the container.

The alternative — implementing the full protocol in Java with careful single-byte reads — is fragile and would need to be re-validated with every JDK update that touches `System.in` buffering behaviour.

### Auto-remote: stateless cleanup vs state tracking
When an instance is destroyed, its git remotes need to be removed from host repos. Two approaches: (1) track which remotes were added in metadata and remove exactly those, or (2) scan host repos for `isx://` URLs matching the instance name. We chose stateless scanning because it's simpler and eliminates a class of state-sync bugs (user manually removes a remote, add failed silently, metadata gets corrupted). The cost is scanning a few git repos on every destroy, which takes milliseconds.

### Single-branch clone with lazy refspec restoration
When cloning from the remote (the fallback path when no host reference is available), template builds use `--single-branch` to avoid fetching objects for all remote branches and tags — on a large project like Quarkus this is the difference between ~3 MiB and ~100 MiB of network traffic. The fetch refspec is immediately widened with `git remote set-branches origin '*'`, which costs nothing (no network, no object transfer) and makes the clone behave like a regular one. Users never need to know they received a single-branch clone; `git fetch`, `git branch -r`, and `git checkout other-branch` all work as expected — other branches just populate on first access.

The local-clone path (from a host reference) does not use `--single-branch` because it copies pack files wholesale regardless — the flag would only narrow the refs, which the follow-up `fetch` and `set-branches` fix anyway. `--single-branch` is reserved for the remote-clone fallback where it actually reduces network transfer.

The alternative — a full remote clone — would download objects for hundreds of branches and thousands of tags that most container workflows never touch. Post-hoc pruning is not straightforward because git doesn't garbage-collect fetched objects unless explicitly told to. The single-branch + refspec-restore approach gets the performance benefit without any user-visible limitation.

### Auto-remote: opt-in via configuration
Auto-remote management requires explicit `host-paths` or `repo-paths` configuration — we don't scan `~` or `/` to auto-discover repos. Within configured `host-paths`, subdirectories are scanned recursively up to 4 levels deep, skipping known non-project directories (`.git`, `node_modules`, `target`, `build`, `vendor`, etc.). This handles the common case where repos are organized in category subfolders (e.g. `~/Code/java/`, `~/Code/go/`). Direct-child matches take priority over nested matches. If the same repo name appears in multiple locations, the operation fails with an error instructing the user to add an explicit `repo-paths` entry to disambiguate.

### Fedora-specific
The base image and package management are Fedora-specific (`dnf`, `images:fedora/44`). This is intentional — supporting multiple distros adds complexity for a tool primarily targeting developer workstations where Fedora is a common choice. The YAML tool system is distro-agnostic in principle (tools can use any shell commands), but the built-in base image setup assumes Fedora.

### Incus Daemon Connection

The CLI communicates with the Incus daemon via its REST API. The transport depends on the platform:

**Linux** (direct): The Incus daemon exposes a Unix domain socket at `/run/incus/unix.socket`. The CLI speaks plain HTTP/1.1 over this socket — no TLS, no authentication (access is governed by Unix socket permissions and the `incus-admin` group). WebSocket-based exec sessions (for `isx shell`, file push, etc.) use the same socket.

**macOS** (via VM): Incus runs inside a VM managed by vfkit. The CLI connects via a **vsock tunnel** — a direct host↔VM communication channel that bypasses the IP network entirely:

```
UnixSocketTransport (plain HTTP/1.1)
  → ~/.local/state/incus-spawn/vm.incus.sock  (legacy Unix socket on host)
    or ~/.local/state/incus-spawn/pools/<name>/vm.incus.sock
    → vfkit virtio-vsock device (port 8443)
      → socat VSOCK-LISTEN:8443 inside VM
        → /run/incus/unix.socket (Incus daemon)
```

vfkit exposes the VM's vsock port 8443 as a Unix domain socket on the host. Inside the VM, socat bridges the vsock listener to the Incus daemon's local Unix socket. The result is that the macOS path reuses the same `UnixSocketTransport` as Linux — plain HTTP, no TLS, no certificates.

**Why vsock instead of HTTPS:** The original macOS transport used HTTPS over TCP to the VM's DHCP-assigned IP (192.168.64.0/24 subnet). This required client certificate generation, server certificate capture, hostname verification bypass (the self-signed cert doesn't include the DHCP IP), and IP rediscovery on VM restart. More critically, corporate VPN software (notably Cisco AnyConnect) installs a macOS socket filter that blocks non-Apple-signed binaries from TCP connections to the VM subnet — even when the VPN is disconnected. Since `isx` is an ad-hoc-signed GraalVM native binary, AnyConnect blocks it from reaching the VM over TCP. vsock bypasses this entirely because it operates outside the IP network stack (`AF_VSOCK`, not `AF_INET`), so socket filters that target TCP connections cannot intercept it. The MITM proxy is unaffected because its traffic flows in the opposite direction — containers inside the VM connect outward to the host, which arrives as inbound traffic to the proxy process, not as an outbound `connect()` from `isx`.

**No HTTPS fallback:** `IncusApi.tryConnect()` selects a transport in order: Linux Unix sockets → vsock Unix socket. The earlier HTTPS-over-TCP path (mutual TLS to the VM's DHCP IP) has been removed — it reintroduced exactly the problems vsock exists to avoid (macOS Local Network permission prompts and VPN socket-filter blocking, described above), and maintaining two transports made field issues hard to diagnose because it was unknowable which path a given user was actually on. (`HttpsTransport` still exists in the tree but is no longer wired into connection selection.)

### macOS vsock robustness

The vfkit vsock tunnel (`AF_VSOCK` across `host unix socket → vfkit → in-VM socat → Incus`) does **not reliably propagate connection close/EOF** — particularly after macOS sleep/resume, when in-flight streams are left half-open. That single fault surfaced in two directions and shaped several design choices:

- **Exec completion is derived from the operation, not the socket.** WebSocket exec (`isx shell`, package installs, git) originally read stdout/stderr until the server closed the fds. When close frames are dropped, `readPayload()` blocks forever. The fix (`IncusApi.execWebSocket`) unifies capture/stream/bidirectional exec and takes the operation `/wait` endpoint — the daemon's operation state, over a normal HTTP request — as the authoritative completion + exit-code signal, then drains and force-closes the data sockets. Completion no longer depends on close-frame delivery. Every exec fd is keepalive-pinged (each is a separate socat child that an inactivity reaper would otherwise collect on a quiet command), and the post-exit drain is **adaptive**: it waits a short minimum for bytes in flight, extends while output is still arriving (so trailing output isn't truncated), and closes shortly after it goes idle.

- **The forwarder leaks, so it needs a backstop and a recovery path.** The same close-propagation gap means the in-VM `socat` forwarder never reaps connections whose close didn't cross the boundary; they pile up as vfkit-held host fds and degrade every new connection (observed: hundreds of leaked streams, `list` latency from sub-second to ~30s). Mitigations: a `socat -T` **inactivity timeout** reaps orphaned children (sized above the 120s `/wait` long-poll, with keepalives so live connections are never reaped); a **keep-alive connection cache** (`ConnectionPool`/`KeepAliveConnection`, via `requestPooled`) reuses a warm connection for short request-path calls (`get`/`post`/`/wait`) instead of reconnecting each time, cutting the churn that feeds the leak (exec WebSocket fds are per-operation and not poolable); and a per-process connection gauge + high-water mark in `UnixSocketTransport` makes accumulation visible.

- **Diagnosis and layer-aware recovery.** The tunnel has two independent failure points: the host-side vfkit forwarding (link 2) and the guest-side socat forwarder (link 3). `isx doctor` and the automatic recovery in `VmManager.ensureRunning()` both compare the host-side fd count (`lsof`) against the in-VM socat child count (agent `socat-count` verb) to localize the wedge via `leakLayer()`: if the guest count is low while the host count is high, vfkit is not reaping (VFKIT); if both are high, the forwarder is lingering children (FORWARDER); if the guest count is zero, the forwarder is not running (always FORWARDER — restarting it is the correct fix regardless of host count). The recovery decision tree in `recoverReachability()`: 10s grace probe → `detectLeakLayer()` → for a VFKIT wedge, fail fast with "run `isx vm restart`" (a forwarder restart cannot fix a host-side problem); for FORWARDER or unknown layer, restart the forwarder via the agent → 15s post-restart probe → 30s backstop. `probeTunnelHealth()` provides the same detection as a public API for proactive TUI/build-time checks, returning `HEALTHY`/`VFKIT_WEDGED`/`FORWARDER_ISSUE`/`UNKNOWN`. Recovery is provided by a small **allowlisted in-VM control agent** (`isx-agent`) on its own vsock port — verbs `ping`, `version`, `socat-count`, `sshd-status`, `forwarder-restart`, `btrfs-usage`, `btrfs-status`, `btrfs-rescan`, no arbitrary exec — reached over an independent channel so it works even when the Incus tunnel is wedged. `forwarder-restart` drops and relaunches the forwarder **without rebooting the VM or stopping containers**, and now verifies the new process started (polls `pgrep` 4×0.5s) before confirming; stderr goes to `/dev/console` (the virtio-serial feeding `vm.log`) so startup errors are visible. See appliance/DESIGN.md for the in-VM side.

### Lifecycle locking

Multiple `isx` processes can modify VM or proxy state concurrently (e.g. `isx vm restart` in one terminal while `ensureRunning()` auto-starts in another). Both `VmManager` and `ProxyService` guard mutating operations with an `fcntl` advisory file lock (`FileChannel.tryLock()`), auto-released on process death. The lock holder class is `AutoCloseable` and used in try-with-resources; public methods (`start`, `stop`, `restart`, `ensureRunning`, `install`, etc.) acquire the lock then delegate to private `*Locked()` variants so a method that calls another mutating method (e.g. `restart` → `stopLocked` + `startLocked`) does not re-lock within the same JVM — Java throws `OverlappingFileLockException` on same-JVM re-acquisition. The VM lock lives at `~/.local/state/incus-spawn/vm.lock` for the legacy VM or `~/.local/state/incus-spawn/pools/<name>/vm.lock` for a named pool; the global proxy lock remains `~/.config/incus-spawn/proxy.lock`. Acquisition retries for 30 seconds with a user-visible wait message before timing out.

## VM Appliance

A minimal Alpine Linux VM image with Incus pre-installed, providing CI integration testing and macOS support. Uses BusyBox init (not systemd or OpenRC) for fastest possible boot. Custom kernel from kernel.org source (zero modules, no initrd) with musl libc for fast dynamic linking. The build produces a rootfs tarball (~30-40 MB) and kernel (~11 MB); a writable btrfs disk image is created on first boot. See [`appliance/DESIGN.md`](appliance/DESIGN.md) for full architecture details.

## Security Considerations

### Container vs VM Trade-off
- **Containers** (default): share host kernel. A kernel exploit could escape. Suitable for semi-trusted code (AI agents with scoped permissions, community bug reproducers).
- **VMs** (`--vm` flag): hardware-level isolation via KVM. Recommended for actively malicious code. Separate kernel eliminates kernel exploit as an escape vector. ~10% performance overhead.

### Credential Isolation

Real API keys and tokens never enter containers, regardless of network mode. Containers hold only placeholder values that satisfy tools' local auth checks; the proxy replaces them with real credentials before requests reach upstream servers.

| Credential | Container has | How it works |
|-----------|--------------|--------------|
| Claude API key (direct mode) | Placeholder `sk-ant-placeholder` | Proxy replaces `x-api-key` header with real key |
| Claude OAuth token (Pro/Max) | Placeholder `sk-ant-placeholder` | Proxy strips `x-api-key` and injects `Authorization: Bearer <oauth-token>`. Container configuration is identical to direct API key mode |
| GCP credentials (Vertex mode) | **Nothing** | Container runs Claude Code in Vertex mode with `CLAUDE_CODE_SKIP_VERTEX_AUTH=1`. Proxy injects GCP Bearer token from `gcloud` on the host. No GCP credentials, service accounts, or access tokens enter the container |
| Pi Anthropic key | Placeholder `sk-ant-placeholder` in `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` | Same as Claude direct/OAuth mode. Pi always uses standard API format; the proxy handles key injection, OAuth Bearer injection, or Vertex translation transparently |
| OpenAI API key | Placeholder `sk-placeholder` in `OPENAI_API_KEY` | Proxy replaces `Authorization: Bearer` header with real key for `api.openai.com`. Behind `openai` feature flag |
| GitHub token | Placeholder `gho_placeholder` in `GITHUB_TOKEN` and `GH_TOKEN` | Proxy replaces `Authorization` header with real token for GitHub domains (Basic auth for `github.com` git HTTP, Bearer for API) |

The MITM TLS proxy provides credential isolation:
1. Bridge-level dnsmasq overrides (configured by `isx proxy`) route intercepted domains to the gateway IP
2. A custom CA certificate (installed in template images) lets containers trust the proxy's TLS certs
3. The proxy terminates TLS, replaces placeholder auth with real credentials, and forwards to real upstream over TLS
4. Placeholder values cannot authenticate against any service — they only bypass local tool checks
5. In proxy-only mode, iptables OUTPUT rules additionally block all egress except the proxy port (443) and DNS

### Filesystem Isolation
- Inbox mount is strictly read-only
- Host resources default to read-only; overlay mode provides an ephemeral writable layer but the host directory is never modified
- Clone filesystems are independent CoW copies — changes in one clone don't affect others or the template image
